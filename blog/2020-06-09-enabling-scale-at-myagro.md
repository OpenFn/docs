_OpenFn is helping small-scale farmers break the cycle of poverty with an
automated savings & supply chain system. Small-scale farmers are feeding the
world, but a majority of them are in an endless cycle of poverty and lack access
to traditional banks and financing. In this post, we highlight our partner
myAgro, an organization leveraging OpenFn automation to help scale its programs
towards its goal of serving 1 million farmers in 2025._

### Here's the overview.

[myAgro](https://www.myagro.org/) has pioneered an innovative bankless savings
plan that allows thousands of farmers to finance themselves and invest their
money in high-quality seeds, fertilizer, tools, and training. OpenFn automates
myAgro’s mobile layaway platform, powering a system where farmers can
incrementally pay for agricultural inputs by purchasing savings vouchers in
local stores—making deposits via SMS. myAgro holds those layaway payments until
planting time, when bulk purchases of seeds, fertilizers, and tools are
delivered to the farmers based on individualized plans.

### What is myAgro?

myAgro helps thousands of farmers in Senegal and Mali save money for seed and
fertilizer using what they already have—their mobile phone. With a mission to
move small-scale farmers out of poverty, myAgro leveraged OpenFn to develop a
mobile layaway platform that connects their Telerivet SMS-based savings deposit
system, Salesforce farmer tracking & supply chain system, and CommCare
barcode-scanning mobile app.

### Using Excel and paper to manage thousands of farmer transactions.

In 2014, myAgro utilized [Telerivet](https://telerivet.com/), an instant SMS and
voice platform, to capture farmer savings deposits, and paper to track voucher
shipments. They would then regularly export the SMS data to an Excel
spreadsheet, and manually match savings deposits against a database of vouchers
before allocating credit to a farmer’s account and sending a confirmation SMS.
Staff spent 1-2 hours per day (or 261+ hours per year) on this data
reconciliation process, which had high potential for human error.

### Where OpenFn comes in...

OpenFn moved this entire manual process over to the cloud, automating the
savings deposit system and connecting a CommCare barcode-scanning mobile app for
real-time farmer order management and inventory tracking. By integrating
Telerivet and Salesforce, myAgro no longer has to rely on data entries and
uploads that would take 1-2 hours each day.

OpenFn now processes all SMS messages automatically, builds trust by providing
instant confirmation to farmers, and eliminates the chance of human error in
savings allocations. OpenFn helped myAgro transition from managing rows and
columns of data in an Excel spreadsheet to an automated savings and inventory
tracking system that enables real-time program monitoring.

- In 2014, myAgro serviced 14,000 farmers across 200 villages in Senegal and
  Mali.
- With the help of OpenFn, myAgro worked with 120,000 farmers in 2019, and plans
  to scale towards its goal of reaching `1 million farmers` by 2025.
