We all staring at a concrete block. We are hot, a little bewildered, deeply
impressed.

Enouce just laughs (he does that a lot) and leads us up a flight of unfinished
stairs, all rough concrete and exposed metal.

It's nice and light now, the last drips of African sun filling the empty
stairwell as we climb. When we return in an hour or so, it'll be pitch dark and
we'll be picking out planets in the clear night sky.

We are in Kenya for our annual company retreat. We try and do this at least once
a year: gathering our team from across Europe and Africa and meeting
face-to-face, old-school, all-analog (baby). We share a week of smiles,
playlists, brainstorms and understanding.

Actually, specifically right now, we're a little ways east of Nairobi, at the
new Vijana Amani Pamoja (Peace Together Youth) community centre. VAP uses sport
to enable, empower and uplift kids and young adults across Kenya. That means
kids kick around a football and get tested for HIV at half-time.

Enouce built all this from nothing. Well, okay, twenty years of sweat and toil
and giving a damn and securing funding and dreaming big, oh so big. But on this
patch of Kenyan wasteland, on land too rough to even kick a football across,
Enouce is building a base to shelter kids and help them build better lives for
themselves.

This is grassroots aid, Kenyans helping Kenyans.

Right now, they are bidding to host the
[Homeless World Cup](https://www.homelessworldcup.org/stories/more-than-a-game-using-football-to-drive-social-change-in-kenya).
I hope they get it - but there's a lot of work to do. We actually came to play
some five-a-side, but the pitch was dug up for renovation that very morning.

VAP is one of the reasons we travel all this way, hopping trains and catching
planes from London, Lisbon, Riga, Dakar, Budapest et al; why we put up with
Murder Birds screaming all night long; why we get the vaccinations and stare
down hippos and wonder if we can drink the water and leave behind everyone we
love.

We come here to observe, understand and discuss our impact on the world. We come
here to check in on the mission (since you ask - increasing the efficient of the
social sectory; automating rote tasks; increasing the quality and accuracy of
social care worldwide).

And of course, the opportunity to meet each other, to communicate face to face,
is irresistible. Priceless. Our team is totally remote, almost each of us in a
different country, so far apart that we measure it in time. We make the most of
every minute.

The launch of [OpenFn v2](https://www.openfn.org/blog/lightning-is-here)
(codenamed Lightning ⚡) dominates the agenda, of course. We plan how to bring
our next-gen open source workflow automation software to market; work out how to
talk about it; list what is left to be done.

We discuss ambitious "moonshot" ideas, dreaming about AI-assisted workflows,
seamless onboarding, live playgrounds. We recap the mission - not that we really
need to - and remind ourselves why what we do matters. We set context for each
other, learn about each other.

We somehow pack ourselves and our luggage into a van that can't possibly fit us
and yet somehow does (shoutout to driver and miracle worker Dixon). A two-hour
drive takes almost the whole day.

We cycle across Hell's Gate National Park (well, some of us); we swim in
sulphurous hot springs; we feed giraffes, watch fish eagles soar and dive. We
are burgled by a baboon (not even joking) and hippos graze outside our cabins at
night.

Our CEO Taylor Downs walks around wrapped in a blanket, looking like a late-era
Luke Skywalker, doing chameleon impressions across the grass. He coins the
phrase "my friend!" and it seems to stick.

We order so much Tusker and Stoney that our hotel throws a complimentary
cocktail hour for us.

Everything is great. Co-working in the real is a joy. Decisions are getting
made. Kenya is paradise.

But something is wrong with this picture.

Time and again it strikes me that, busy as we are, the world around us moves at
a very different pace.

We drive down red, rocky roads, lined with people just... waiting. No-one
rushes. Staff at our hotel work dawn to dust and beyond - longer than we do. Our
driver takes us to the office and, with nothing better to do, waits around
on-site, washing the bus, chatting with the security guards.

When Dave Graeber wrote about
["bullshit jobs"](https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom),
I don't think this is what he meant.

There seems to be a lot of spare time here. I wonder about that.

If I ever work out what it means, I'll let you know.

Maybe this is the real reason we're here. We spend our lives fighting
inequality, in our own small, specialised way, reducing inefficiency in parts of
the world where every dollar, every drop of water, is precious.

Maybe the only way to understand our impact is to immerse ourselves in places
like this. Maybe this is how we understand the mission.

Hang on, I'm trying to round off this ramble into some kind of point but I
haven't even told you about [AkiraChix](https://akirachix.com/) yet. That's the
best bit.

The AkiraChix HQ hosts us for our working conference. They are a sort of a
sister organisation for us as we are both funded (in part) by the McGovern
Foundation.

The heart of AkiraChix is the
[codeHive](https://akirachix.com/programs/codeHive/) program: a one year,
live-in coding bootcamp for young adult women. The students live and learn on
the beautiful campus in the Nairobi district of Karen, learning about front-end
web development, dev-ops, distributed systems, game development, and more. All
accommodation, tuition and food costs are covered.

When their training is completed they go off and work in industry (they cite an
80% placement rate last year), but also come back to the campus to teach and
support the next cohort.

We are lucky enough to speak to some of these young women. The students are
quiet, polite, softly spoken, curious. The graduates are bold, outspoken,
switched-on. The difference is night and day, the transformation remarkable.

This is a lifeline in a world where tech roles tend to be inaccessible and
intimidating to women, where girls are driven away from science, maths and
computing and towards family, fashion and art. It's an endemic cultural problem
in "the west" and even worse in Africa, where crippling poverty exacerbates the
problem, chokes the pool of opportunity.

It's such a valuable, important, righteous, and cool project that we hired one
of their graduates.

Also, the food they served every day was incredible - colourful, varied,
imaginative, playful. I've never eaten better.

And doesn't that just tell you something about Western perceptions of Africa?
Yes, there is famine and poverty and incredible hardship across the continent.
But there are also passionate, talented people, providing critical services
every single day.

Kenya is paradise - but not for everyone. But if we keep working, if we keep
driving at this wedge of inequality, if we keep empowering lives with
technilogy - really good, careful, considerate technology - we can make it a
safe, productive and inspiring place for even more people.
