For the first time, the dashboard provided key child protection related data in one platform, enabling policy makers and service providers to more effectively monitor and evaluate child protection programmes as well as supporting planning and decision making.</p><p>This project was a culmination of work that started in 2018, which included the configuration of CPIMS and development of the monitoring framework for child protection. As part of the CPIMS initiative, UNICEF Cambodia also supported the MoSVY to establish and implement the <a href=\"http://primero.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primero</a> case management system, a tool that supports government social service workers to facilitate case management for children who are at risk of or experience violence and other child protection concerns in any setting. </p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cambodia child\" src=\"/assets/images/cambodia-kids-d4cf8c39bc6987a5a91cfa6d619ce9ba.png\" width=\"928\" height=\"616\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><em>Knowledge E, 2020</em></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"openfn-automation-keeps-the-dashboard-in-sync\">OpenFn automation keeps the dashboard in-sync<a href=\"#openfn-automation-keeps-the-dashboard-in-sync\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OpenFn automation keeps the dashboard in-sync\" title=\"Direct link to OpenFn automation keeps the dashboard in-sync\">​</a></h2><p>When the CPIMS dashboard was first launched, it was not connected directly to Primero (the system where case information is managed).

They customize small, mid-range and large open source health applications for Ministries of Health, medical councils, medical doctor practices, health groups and hospitals in the Caribbean. <strong>OS4H is also our first certified OpenFn implementation partner in the Caribbean, trained to deliver workflow automation projects to help their regional partners achieve health systems interoperability.</strong> </p><p> Peter Ricketts, CEO at OS4H, says the Dominica-based team provides sustainable solutions designed to meet the needs of organizations in small island developing states (SIDS) that will strengthen their health management operations. While OS4H specializes in digital health implementations for the Caribbean, their team of IT specialists also works across other sectors, including education and agriculture. </p><blockquote><p>“At OS4H, our mission is to improve health outcomes by matching the right technologies to the problems and build the supporting framework around it to ensure it is implemented and sustained over the long run. We believe in making high quality data and information available to those who need it, where they need it, and when they need it in a sustainable manner.”  - Peter Ricketts</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"osh4h-team\" src=\"/assets/images/os4h-team-ba9808a4b030f5f36bd25a6a9f4cd41c.png\" width=\"1240\" height=\"920\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><em>Above: Members of the Open Solutions for Health team based in Roseau, Dominica.</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This year, OS4H has been working with partners at the St. Lucia Ministry of Health (MOH) to expand their in-country DHIS2 implementation to monitor key immunization indicators so that they can strengthen management operations against vaccine preventable diseases. Check out <a href=\"https://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/press-release-for-world-immunization-week-open-solutions-for-health-delivers-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this press release</a> to learn more about the project supported by the <a href=\"https://www.paho.org/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)</a>.</p><p>DHIS2 offers robust dashboard and data visualization options, but St. Lucia’s immunization data was collected in a separate database, along with sensitive patient information that should only be accessed by authorized users. Therefore, to (i) avoid manual data entry and indicators calculations, and (ii) minimize access to sensitive patient data, OS4H sought to automate the reporting of key immunization indicators to DHIS2. After researching secure, open source, and OpenHIE-compliant options for data integration, OS4H decided to deliver this solution using the OpenFn workflow automation platform. </p><p><strong>In less than 1 month, OS4H successfully designed and implemented workflow automation on OpenFn that integrates the St. Lucia Health Information System (“SLUHIS”) database with DHIS2, enabling regular, nation-wide monitoring of key immunization indicators for MOH staff and epidemiologists.</strong></p><p>This OS4H implementation consisted of two phases: (1) training on the OpenFn platform and(2) implementation of the automated workflow for St. Lucia. </p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"os4h-is-now-a-certified-openfn-implementer\">OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer<a href=\"#os4h-is-now-a-certified-openfn-implementer\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer\" title=\"Direct link to OS4H is now a certified OpenFn implementer\">​</a></h2><p>At OpenFn, we have a small implementation team that cannot meet the rising demand for workflow automation we’re seeing worldwide. Therefore, we are investing more in partner enablement to help develop the automation expertise and OpenFn implementation capacity of local IT teams solving local problems–like OS4H in the Caribbean. Earlier this year, our core team launched the OpenFn Implementation Partner Program to offer training on the OpenFn Digital Public Good, as well as on our implementation process. </p><p>To quickly learn how to implement OpenFn, the OS4H team completed the OpenFn Partner Onboarding Training to learn about the OpenFn product suite, as well as how to successfully design and deliver workflow automation implementations end-to-end. Over the course of 2 weeks, OS4H team members attended online training sessions and completed “homework” exercises to practice OpenFn fundamentals and prepare for their upcoming, real-world projects. At the end of the training, the OS4H team officially joined the <a href=\"https://community.openfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenFn Community</a>, received “OpenFn Essentials” badges for OpenFn administration and development, and were prepared to kick off their first implementation with the St. Lucia Ministry of Health.</p><blockquote><p>\"After adopting the OpenHIE reference architecture, we began exploring the various referenced technologies. Upon review of the interoperability layer technologies, <strong>we quickly appreciated the versatility and ease of use of OpenFn.</strong></p><p>When data transformation is needed, OpenFn utilizes JavaScript, a scripting language that is familiar to most developers in the Caribbean. This meant a <strong>lower learning curve, enabling us to get up and running relatively quickly.</strong> Furthermore, the support from the OpenFn core team allowed us to build in-house capacity for the full delivery cycle of an OpenFn project.\" - Peter Ricketts</p></blockquote><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"automating-indicators-reporting-for-the-moh\">Automating indicators reporting for the MOH<a href=\"#automating-indicators-reporting-for-the-moh\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Automating indicators reporting for the MOH\" title=\"Direct link to Automating indicators reporting for the MOH\">​</a></h2><p>Following the OpenFn training, the OS4H team successfully led the design and implementation of a solution which integrates SLUHIS, the St. Lucia MOH's health information system built on a PostgreSQL database, with their DHIS2 reporting system. </p><p>This process involved consultations with St. Lucia MOH partners to understand the SLUHIS data structure and how to map SLUHIS data points to the DHIS2 data model. Once the data mapping requirements and workflow steps were clearly defined, then OS4H was able to configure the workflow on OpenFn and schedule the automation to run hourly. </p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"osh4h-flow\" src=\"/assets/images/os4h-flow-e1827c7d3c58e6c5acd17ccdf76308d9.png\" width=\"1176\" height=\"300\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p><strong>How the workflow automation works:</strong></p><ol><li>On an hourly basis, OpenFn executes complex SQL queries to extract and aggregate immunization data from the SLUHIS PostgreSQL database.</li><li>OpenFn next fetches a list of “data mapping rules” from SLUHIS, which inform how municipalities should be reassigned to organization units in the DHIS2 location hierarchy.</li><li>OpenFn then maps the SLUHIS aggregated indicators results to related DHIS2 data elements to prepare the data for import.</li><li>Finally, using the DHIS2 adaptor, OpenFn imports data values to DHIS2, updating linked indicators and dashboards. </li></ol><p>As the workflow runs, all activity history can be centrally monitored in the OpenFn platform, and alerts are configured to notify St. Lucia MOH partners if any errors are thrown. </p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"osh4h-dashboard\" src=\"/assets/images/os4h-dashboard-c04a1320f4658d2d8b2d7b637cb9f14f.png\" width=\"1140\" height=\"948\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><em>Above: Screenshot of the test DHIS2 dashboard for key immunization indicators, which displays data from SLUHIS that is aggregated and updated by OpenFn daily.

Historically, most of our revenue came from selling\nsoftware licenses and doing implementation work around a proprietary web\napplication built on top of the open-source OpenFn integration toolkit. We have\nreinvested our earned revenue over the years into the development of this free\nand open source (FOSS) toolkit. In recent years, since committing to making the\nnext version of our flagship product fully open-source, we’ve also received key\ngrants, donations, and pull requests to strengthen the toolkit and this next\nversion, OpenFn/Lightning, directly.</p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/sffh.png\" width=\"400\" class=\"img_ev3q\"><p>The <strong>Steele Foundation for Hope</strong> is a foundation that invests in lasting\nsolutions for some of humanity’s hardest challenges. They believe that advances\nfound through technology and innovation are key to improving quality of life for\nless fortunate people around the world. They share our vision for a diverse,\nthriving ICT4D sector with local ownership of solutions and distribution of\npower, and we are incredibly excited to have their backing for this next stage\nOpenFn’s growth.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-were-doing\">What we're doing<a href=\"#what-were-doing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What we're doing\" title=\"Direct link to What we're doing\">​</a></h2><p>Making our flagship product fully open-source is important to our long-term\nstrategy for impact at scale. Even when governments and NGOs choose a managed\nOpenFn offering, they need to know that they're not locked in. They've got to\nown their solution, and that means having the substantive freedom to implement,\ndeploy, run, maintain, or easily migrate off OpenFn when and however they want.</p><p>At the same time, customers running critical workflows on OpenFn only chose our\ntechnology in the first place because they're confident that it's well built,\nwell maintained, and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In other words, they\nwant robust software that's supported by reliable businesses—in that sense, they\ndo not want us to do anything that might threaten the long-term sustainability\nof the company that built it.</p><p>Donor funding to enhance our open source software and documentation has been\nabsolutely pivotal to date, and we’ll continue to receive grant funding for\nthis, <strong>but the investment from the Steele Foundation allows us to do something\ndifferent.</strong> It allows us to expand key aspects of our <em>business</em> that may\nultimately help us reduce our reliance on donors and drastically expand the\nsocial impact of the free and open source digital public good we provide.</p><p>Two major initiatives that are already underway are a UX redesign focused on\nnew-user onboarding and the development of a new channel partner certification\nprogram. Through the latter, we've seen staff at two different partner\norganizations get certified and one has gone on to deliver an OpenFn\nimplementation with the Ministry of Health in St. Lucia, automating a vaccine\nreporting workflow involving DHIS2 and a custom ministry database.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-this-means-for-the-dpg\">What this means for the DPG<a href=\"#what-this-means-for-the-dpg\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What this means for the DPG\" title=\"Direct link to What this means for the DPG\">​</a></h2><p>So what does an investment in Open Function Group mean for the future of the\nOpenFn DPG?</p><p>First, it means we have the ability to set and execute on a longer-term strategy\nfor the product—one that we feel will allow the impact of the DPG to grow\nexponentially by decoupling adoption from the growth of our own core team. A\nlarge portion of this investment will go directly into the design and\nimplementation of features in the Lightning code base, made in conversation with\nour open-source steering committee for the immediate benefit of the whole\ncommunity.</p><p>Second, we'll be able to back up that new product strategy with serious capacity\nbuilding and business generation initiatives that grow the implementer\nnetwork—this means that there will be more capable OpenFn implementers within\ngovernments, NGOs, and for-profit consultancies all over the world.</p><p>Finally, as we iterate on and improve our software-delivery-as-a-service\n(hosting, deployment, maintenance, support) model, we’ll achieve greater\nfinancial stability, safeguarding the continued development of the DPG for years\nto come.</p><h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"one-more-thing\">One more thing<a href=\"#one-more-thing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to One more thing\" title=\"Direct link to One more thing\">​</a></h2><p>This is a significant moment for the OpenFn community.

For personal reasons,\nI didn’t really plan on being here long - but I thought I could help out for a\nwhile.</p><p>\"Hey,\" says CEO Taylor Downs, one winter’s morning. \"Do you want to come to Cape\nTown with us?\"</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bo-Kaap\" src=\"/assets/images/bo-kaap-8ef429926bd7946d17c16fa737c9efd8.webp\" width=\"1462\" height=\"1097\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>I am not well traveled - I’ve never left Europe, let alone stepped foot on\nAfrican soil. So I enthusiastically agree.</p><p>And I’m not the only one. Between us, we have traveled 40,000 miles to be in\nDistrict Six, Cape Town - from London, Dakar, Arusha, Riga, Nairobi. It has\ntaken us over 150 hours to get here.</p><p>Right now we are gathered around this table, in this hot little room, scribbling\nour truths onto this oversized piece of paper. We are, in our own little way,\ntrying to make the world a better place.</p><p>Suddenly the fan stops, the lights go out, the projector goes dark.</p><p>Load shedding just struck.</p><p>But the conversation doesn’t even waver. Eyes briefly flick to the light\nfixtures, but we remain focused on refining our mission, putting an edge on our\npurpose, comparing visions on how, where and when we can make a difference.</p><p>We have traveled all this way to figure out how to best work together.</p><p>If we don’t get this right, we can’t achieve our mission. We are digital nomads,\nspread throughout Europe, Africa and North America. We rarely meet in physical\nspace. Technology enables us to collaborate, but it brings its fair share of\nchallenges too.</p><p>\"Sitting down all day is <em>dangerous</em>,\" says Taylor. \"We have to make this\n<em>count</em>.\"</p><p>It has taken weeks of preparation and worry to get here. I’ve been arranging\ntravel, visas, domestic stuff, vaccinations. Since covid broke out, for three\nyears now, my partner and I have worked from home, in the same small flat,\nalways together. I fight back tears as we kiss goodbye on the doorstep, and\nstart my long journey.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Obligatory team photo\" src=\"/assets/images/team-cape-point-2a14bec98c59366e708d659af5e8f830.webp\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>It's an overnight flight. I do not sleep. I hit Cape Town tarmac at 7am,\nscrabble for a data connection at 8am, collapse into Stu's car at 9am. I watch\nthe city, the townships, the shanty villages, the mountains; a new world drifts\nsilently past the window. The environment is beautiful, the poverty is\nheartbreaking.</p><p>In Simon’s Town, as I shake hands with my colleagues for the first time, we\nlearn things about each other that months of video conferencing could never\nreveal.</p><p>By the end of the first day I am already exhausted, overwhelmed, burned out from\nadrenaline.</p><p>Over the weekend, we walk, we swim, we kick a football, we drive, we eat, we\nimmerse ourselves in penguins (did you know Cape town has penguins?).</p><p>At an artistic retreat in Scarborough, we sculpt from clay, eyes closed, hands\nbusy, minds focused. A safe space, our guide tells us nervously, unsure how to\nbreak an ice that has suddenly formed in 30 degree heat.</p><p>It is at the same time austere and liberating, creative and claustrophobic,\nindividual and collective. We swap chairs and work on each other’s sculptures -\nnervously, at first, unwilling to do harm, but soon embracing the opportunity to\nco-imagine, to co-create.</p><p>In the end it is a joy from which, I think, we all emerged changed.</p><p>“It was a little too woo-woo for me”, says Taylor, tears still drying in his\neyes. It is the most reassuring thing I have heard in days.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Taylor, laughing in the face of danger\" src=\"/assets/images/taylor-baboons-44169681c781ecfe699ed852e88b1145.webp\" width=\"1170\" height=\"878\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>Later, as the sun sets behind us, on a Cape Town beach, we share our stories.\nBetween us we barely have a single thing in common - be it language, religion,\neducation, gender, background, hobbies. But maybe, it emerges, there is one\nthing - just one slender thread - which connects us after all: a determination\nto fight inequality.</p><p>We are not righteous. We all know we can’t save the world. We are not in the\nbusiness of toppling regimes, redistributing wealth, healing the sick. We do not\nbear torches.</p><p>But we do have a contribution to make. Automation is our thing. We believe that\nwe can improve critical business processes in the “developing world” - the\nplaces that big tech doesn’t care about - by taking away tedium, building trust\nand transparency, and reducing errors.</p><p>In the office, unfazed by power cuts, we explore working practices, discuss\ncultural differences, deepen our respect.</p><p>We learn how to talk about and discuss our data integration technology -\nsomething so abstract that often even highly technical people don’t get it. We\nlearn how our technology helps the people Silicon Valley overlooks. We share\nstories, explore ideas, learn about ourselves and the business.</p><p>On the penultimate day, I find myself overwhelmed with grief. Soon we depart to\ndifferent corners of the world, vanish behind our screens. Yes, I miss my big\nmonitor, my safe space, my family, my drinks cabinet, my PlayStation, my wok.\nBut I know that this special, sacred shared time is ending - and later I will\nmiss the company of my colleagues more than the comforts of home.</p><p>Somewhere during this long pandemic, between fleeing an unsafe office and\nthriving in isolation, I Iost something. I forgot something important, something\nabout connecting to people, something about society, the world, my place in it.</p><p>In Cape Town, and with the humans of Open Function, I found it once more.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"An OpenHuman at Camps Bay Beach\" src=\"/assets/images/joe-beach-8e78a45a1bdebed5920682ecf4de7bda.webp\" width=\"674\" height=\"899\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>",

To better monitor impact\nacross its portfolio, Itaú Social began partnering with Vera Solutions in 2018\nto build a centralized M&amp;E information system using Amp Impact, Vera's packaged\nimpact measurement and portfolio management app built on the Salesforce cloud\nplatform. For more on the Amp Impact solution, check out the Vera Solutions\n<a href=\"https://www.verasolutions.org/portfolio/itau-social/?locale=en#:~:text=Founded%20in%201993%2C%20Ita%C3%BA%20Social,research%20in%20the%20education%20sector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">case study</a>.</p><p>To analyze impact across its immense network of partner organizations, programs,\nand students, Itaú Social staff spend lots of time and money to manually export\nand load data between multiple partner data systems and its M&amp;E Amp Impact /\nSalesforce solution. Exchanging data via manual, human-dependent processes also\nincreases the risk of human error, impacting data quality and data security\nvulnerability, and makes it difficult to track data loading errors.</p><p>Using OpenFn, Itaú Social has automated its most critical data exchange\nworkflows across partner systems, minimizing the need for staff to manually\nmigrate data to its M&amp;E system. OpenFn enables automated data sharing, cleaning,\nand reporting, thereby increasing efficiency and data quality of these\nworkflows. This has ultimately helped Itaú Social achieve faster, data-driven\ndecision-making and better outcomes for students across Brazil.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Brazil Students\" src=\"/assets/images/brazil_students-9d8a1d0e568994e5ad723a890f776815.png\" width=\"934\" height=\"580\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"two-source-systemsone-destination\">Two source systems–one destination.<a href=\"#two-source-systemsone-destination\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Two source systems–one destination.\" title=\"Direct link to Two source systems–one destination.\">​</a></h3><p>OpenFn is helping Itaú Social consolidate data from two source data systems into\nAmp Impact / Salesforce.</p><table><thead><tr><th align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Itaú Integration Diagram\" src=\"/assets/images/itau_integration_diagram-f1827174369133c136297c758731fc1c.png\" width=\"756\" height=\"232\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"center\"><b>The current implementation integrates data from an API and SFTP server with Salesforce.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"source-1---web-api\">Source 1 - Web API:<a href=\"#source-1---web-api\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Source 1 - Web API:\" title=\"Direct link to Source 1 - Web API:\">​</a></h4><p>Itaú Social uses an internal, custom-built system to collect and store important\ninformation about partner organization registration and about enrollment data\nfor the students they serve.

My cousin Mariam’s experience with healthcare\nin Conakry serves as an example. After visiting three clinics and hospitals in\nConakry, Mariam was diagnosed with kidney stones at the fourth one. All of the\ndata that was collected in the first three clinics were not accessible to her\ndoctor at the fourth one. At each clinic the same data was collected and doctors\nrelied on Mariam to provide her medical history. They asked about past visits,\nprevious diagnoses, prescriptions, lab results, etc. Her medical history was\nspread across paper and electronic systems, in her home, at different\npharmacies, and in labs. Imagine how much faster she could have been diagnosed\nand treated if her healthcare workers had access to a comprehensive view of her\nmedical history.</p><p>A health information exchange would mitigate these issues and allow data to be\nstored in a single database. All authorized stakeholders would be able to access\nand update this single health record and Mariam wouldn’t need to stress about\nher paper prescription she lost from years ago. <strong>Patient data is only one piece\nof the puzzle and other important health data such as information on facilities,\nproviders, and supplies can also be managed in the health information exchange\nsystem.</strong></p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"openfns-role\">OpenFn's Role<a href=\"#openfns-role\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OpenFn's Role\" title=\"Direct link to OpenFn's Role\">​</a></h3><p>Two key components of a health information exchange are <strong>interoperability and\ndata standards.</strong> The OpenFn Integration Toolkit is a tool for interoperability\nsolution design, implementation, and adherence to data standards in health\ninformation exchange–key for organizations seeking to securely increase\ninteroperability across systems and partners, reduce costs, strengthen health\nsystems, and improve service delivery.

Each integration project may be completely\ndifferent in terms of <em>how</em> data is processed (i.e., the “business rules”) but\nthere are some basic requirements and best-practices that can serve as the\nbuilding blocks for successful interoperability across almost any set of\nsystems. That’s no surprise to us; it’s the fundamental premise of OpenFn.\nWhat’s expanded dramatically through our work in Cambodia, however, is our\ncollection of <em><strong>reusable processes</strong></em>—how to approach integration long before\nyou open up a computer—that can now serve as a template for future projects.</p><p>One such process is the “Integration Checklist”, a non-technical checklist that\nhelps organizations bring together relevant stakeholders and define the value\nand rules of an integration. This is no small thing. In the Primero post\nmentioned above, Jan Panchalingam, also a Child Protection Specialist at UNICEF,\nwrites that implementing OpenFn is “changing the way they work”.</p><p>The “aha” moment for those involved in this project was that the artifacts\nproduced in an OpenFn implementation—actual\n<a href=\"/documentation/build/triggers\">“triggers”</a> and\n<a href=\"/documentation/build/workflows\">“jobs”</a> written with and for the Open Source\nIntegration Toolkit—publicly memorialize the data sharing agreements between\npartners.</p><p>I want to stick with that for a moment: <strong>the implementation <em>is</em> the\nagreement!</strong></p><div class=\"theme-admonition theme-admonition-success alert alert--success admonition_LlT9\"><div class=\"admonitionHeading_tbUL\"><span class=\"admonitionIcon_kALy\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z\"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class=\"admonitionContent_S0QG\"><p>By <strong>operationalizing a data sharing agreement</strong> through OpenFn, these\norganizations now have machine-readable granularity, full revision history, and\nproof-of-processing for their contract.</p></div></div><p>A huge portion of the work required to make the case management systems\ninteroperable was done on calls, walking through different referral flows and\nprivacy requirements and getting buy-in from various stakeholders and legal\nentities. Now, the output of those crucial conversations are not just notes or a\nsigned MOU and careful task lists for system admins, they are a series of\nscripts that are stored and actually enacted, faithfully, automatically, and\nmany times every day by the OpenFn platform–automating data exchange between\npartner agencies.</p><p>By implementing OpenFn—defining the case referral process and the requirements\nof the agreement in machine-readable levels of specificity—they’ve actually\nremoved huge amounts of ambiguity and helped standardize the data sharing\nagreements between partner ministries/organizations.</p><p>And the reusability of these processes isn’t just theoretical. They are already\nbeing applied in three other big UNICEF implementations as we speak. The next to\ngo live will be in Thailand.</p><p>UNICEF and the Thai Ministry of Public Health are working to enable social\nprotection caseworkers using the Primero app to access relevant patient medical\nhistory securely, via OpenFn and a ministry-managed API gateway. By\nforegrounding the checklist, and making sure all the stakeholders in these\nsensitive data-sharing agreements are on board with the concept that this\nimplementation is a way of formalizing and enforcing data sharing agreements,\nthe teams have been able to move much more confidently through the initial\nprototyping process. At OpenFn, we plan to continue to build out the open source\nprocess documentation that goes alongside the software—making it easier for\nfolks everywhere to achieve durable interoperability and manifest their data\nsharing agreements.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"one-more-thing-on-the-subject-of-open-source\">One more thing.

On the subject of open source.\">​</a></h3><p><strong>Open source is about freedom of choice, not money.</strong></p><p>For the moment, in both Cambodia and Thailand, the implementations are running\non OpenFn.org—our proprietary cloud-hosted service—but in both cases they’re\nalready evaluating plans to migrate these implementations to make use of the\nFOSS-only deployment pathway we provide in the Open Source Integration Toolkit.</p><p>I think that’s hugely important. A cloud-hosted service might be the best option\nfor a given ministry during prototype, pilot, scale-up, or even national-scale\ndeployments—oftentimes they’re less expensive and more secure—<b><i>but for\nsystems as important as these, it’s absolutely critical that they’re not locked\nin.</i></b></p><p>Governments must be free to export that implementation and run it on completely\nopen source software that they can debug, on whatever servers they’d like, with\nsupport from whatever vendors they choose.</p><p>This is what recent investment in the Open Source Integration Toolkit, from\nDigital Square, the FCDO, DIAL, and our team here at OpenFn has made possible.\nFrom software, to documentation, to process and implementation guides like those\nmentioned above, the goal of the toolkit is to build up the integration\ncapability of the sector at large. Ultimately the toolkit will ensure that\nOpenFn implementations aren’t forever reliant on a single company. It will\nincrease the substantive freedom of governments to make long-term plans and take\nlong-term ownership of their integration solutions, without having to re-code\nthe wheel.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"to-take-action\">To take action<a href=\"#to-take-action\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to To take action\" title=\"Direct link to To take action\">​</a></h3><p>To join our community please sign up to our\n<a href=\"https://community.openfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community page </a>and feel free to contribute and\nask questions on the forum.</p><p>If your organization is thinking about interoperability and would like to learn\nmore about OpenFn’s platform or open-source offerings please contact\n<a href=\"mailto:services@openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">services@openfn.org</a> for a free consultation.</p><p>Also, be sure to stay tuned to our <a href=\"/blog\">blog</a>, or subscribe to our\n<a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hcOw8H\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">newsletter</a> to stay up to date with all ICT4D\nintegration related news.</p>",

What\nmotivated this panel’s formation was a growing awareness that as digital\ntechnology reshapes economies and society, it is imperative that the\ntechnologies deployed do not exacerbate global inequities, but instead seek to\naddress them.</p><p>Co-Chaired by Melinda Gates and Jack Ma, the panel’s\n<a href=\"https://digitalcooperation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DigitalCooperation-report-web-FINAL-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">final report</a>\nprovided recommendations for how the international community could work together\nto harness digital technologies for positive change. One of the key action items\nthat emerged in the report’s aftermath was a call for global investment into the\ncreation of <strong>digital public goods to help attain the sustainable development\ngoals. </strong>Specifically, availability and accessibility to digital public\ngoods—and the data they collect—was introduced as being essential to address\nissues of digital inclusion for all regardless of location, race, gender,\nreligion or socioeconomic standing.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"what-is-open-source\">What is open source?<a href=\"#what-is-open-source\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What is open source?\" title=\"Direct link to What is open source?\">​</a></h3><p>Not all open source projects are digital public goods, but all digital public\ngoods must be open source. Open source software is code that is publicly\naccessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. Many\ngovernments and international NGOs prefer open source software because of\ncustomization and data residency requirements. Since our founding in 2014 OpenFn\nhas been committed to open-source software development and the source code for\nmost of the products we’ve built is freely available on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/OpenFn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github</a>.</p><p>Notably, even though open source software is “free” the cost of deploying it and\nmaintaining it carries costs that are sometimes comparable to commercial\nsoftware licenses.\n<a href=\"https://digitalsquare.org/blog/2020/2/13/openness-and-value-in-the-digital-health-sector\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Square </a>explains\nthis dynamic further: “The misconception of open source as ‘free’ may be better\nunderstood through the Romance languages. Open source is\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">libre, not gratis</a>: free as\nin speech, not as in lunch. In the case of many low resource settings, this is\nthe right kind of free. The need for adaptability is balanced by the ability to\nadapt a software.”</p><p>An example of a successful open source software project that is also classified\nas a digital public good is <a href=\"https://openlmis.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenLMIS</a>. OpenLMIS is the\nleading logistics system used to track health products across national supply\nchains and while they credit their open source approach as being responsible for\ntheir deployment success to date, they have also experienced challenges related\nto their business model. Business model challenges force open source project\nmaintainers like OpenLMIS and OpenFn to explore different types of revenue\nstreams that ensure long term sustainability of the projects.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"how-openfns-business-model-will-enable-long-term-sustainability-of-its-open-source-project\">How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project<a href=\"#how-openfns-business-model-will-enable-long-term-sustainability-of-its-open-source-project\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project\" title=\"Direct link to How OpenFn’s business model will enable long term sustainability of its open source project\">​</a></h3><p>Historically, lacking grant funding and without outside investors, OpenFn\ndecided that the best way to continue delivering high-impact implementations and\nkeep a laser focus on the needs of real-world NGOs that we serve was to build a\nlicensed, closed-source software-as-a-service (SaaS) product offering (see\n<a href=\"http://www.openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">openfn.org</a>). This product is dependent on the huge\nsuite of open-source software that we continue to invest in for the good of the\nlarger community—“core”, “adaptors”, and almost all of the software we build is\nopen source—but by licensing our SaaS we’ve been able to create a steady stream\nof revenue that is only dependent on real-world customers seeing and paying for\nthe value they get by using the product. Selling subscriptions to the OpenFn\nplatform has not only helped it grow into a strong, trusted, enterprise-grade\nproduct, but it has bootstrapped our implementation arm, subsidized our “free\nforever” enterprise tier, and funded the further development of our open source\ntools.</p><p>Thanks to recent support from DIAL, DFID and Digital Square, OpenFn is now able\nto invest more time and energy into our open-source tools—building new software\nto compete with and complement more directly our licensed platform and working\nto make the existing tools more accessible to a wider audience.The licensed\nplatform and our open source project have a symbiotic relationship with one\nanother. Open source innovation drives platform innovation and vice versa.\nCrucially, both rely on each other.</p><p>With a more robust <a href=\"/documentation/deploy/portability\">open source offering </a>and\na heavy investment in documentation, it will be easier than ever for\norganizations to get up and running with OpenFn and then choose whether they\nwant to scale their solutions on the platform or deploy them on their own\ninfrastructure using nothing but free open source software (FOSS).</p><p>Some will still choose to use our hosted offering, and we’ll be encouraged to\nfurther differentiate that offering through the value that it provides—<!-- -->_<!-- -->not\n<!-- -->_<!-- -->merely by virtue of it being proprietary. In fact, we see a future in which\nNGOs and governments may shift seamlessly between all of our tools.

The good news is that OpenFn integration\n<a href=\"/documentation/deploy/portability\">portability</a> will make these transitions easy. Your\nintegration will run just as well on your servers as ours.</p><p>As the diagram below demonstrates we envision two main pathways for OpenFn\nintegrations.

Because achieving\ninteroperability can be complex, OpenFn was brought into the consortium to offer\nexpert integration insights and to provide the digital infrastructure required\nto enable the program’s goals.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-systems-integrated\">The Systems Integrated<a href=\"#the-systems-integrated\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The Systems Integrated\" title=\"Direct link to The Systems Integrated\">​</a></h3><p>The systems OpenFn integrated for the first phase of this project are\n<a href=\"https://www.primero.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primero</a> and <a href=\"https://oscarhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OSCaR</a>. Primero\nis an open source software platform that helps social services, humanitarian and\ndevelopment workers manage protection-related data, with modules that facilitate\ncase management, incident monitoring and family tracing and reunification. OSCaR\n(Open Source Case-management and Record-keeping) is a case management software\nsystem that is used by civil society organizations in Cambodia to manage cases\nor children in residential care.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Primero OpenFn Oscar Diagram\" src=\"/assets/images/primero_oscar-164912ef651cecccb7b2e559986c3037.png\" width=\"1534\" height=\"694\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>First a definition: “Interoperability”, in this context, is the automated\nability of computer systems to work in concert with (sharing data and\ncollaborating on processes with) other systems. Defining interoperability is the\neasy part; achieving it is another story. “In a complex, interagency project\nlike this, it’s true that the technologies in play often don’t ‘speak the same\nlanguage’, but neither do the partners,” writes Aleksa Krolls, OpenFn’s Head of\nServices. “Our job is not only to facilitate the flow of data between systems,\nbut to facilitate the process by which our partners—human users—communicate\nmeaning across multiple agencies and people.”</p><p>In this example, OpenFn’s software is acting as the “translator” between the\nOSCaR and Primero systems. OpenFn’s primary interoperability objective for this\nfirst phase was to facilitate Cambodian government partners and local\nnon-governmental organizations in systematic registration and tracking of\nchildren in Cambodia, including facilitating duplicate detection between systems\nand enabling easy-to-use processes for updating beneficiary/client details.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"the-work-is-just-beginning\">The work is just beginning<a href=\"#the-work-is-just-beginning\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to The work is just beginning\" title=\"Direct link to The work is just beginning\">​</a></h3><p>OpenFn’s work with UNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY doesn’t end here though. We are\nnow beginning the process of enabling further Primero interoperability with\nsoftware like ProGres v2, UNHCR’s institutional tool, as well as enabling\nPrimero-to-Primero implementations in the field. We’ll be sure to keep the\ncommunity updated as the project progresses.</p><p>Many of the best responses to the critical issues we face as a society emerge\nfrom collaboration and interoperability enables collaboration in the digital\ndomain. Just as no single actor or organization can deliver all the services\nrequired to protect vulnerable children and survivors of violence, no single\ntechnology can be successful operating in isolation.</p><p>Case management automation allows for a social worker to spend more time being\nthere for the vulnerable populations they serve and less time copying and\npasting data between the applications they use. This partnership between OpenFn,\nUNICEF Cambodia and the MoSVY means that fewer children will need to painfully\nre-tell their traumas just to receive the help they need.</p><p>If your organization is in the health and humanitarian sector and is thinking\nabout automation and interoperability, contact <a href=\"mailto:services@openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">services@openfn.org</a> for a free\nconsultation.</p><p><strong>About UNICEF Cambodia:</strong> UNICEF Cambodia’s mission is to promote the healthy\ndevelopment of children, to defend their rights and help them fulfil their\npotential, from early childhood to adolescence.</p><p><strong>About Cambodia’s Ministry of Social Affairs, Veterans and Youth Rehabilitation\n(MoSVY):</strong> Cambodia’s MoSVY is a government agency with a broad mandate that\nincludes supporting the efforts of social workers across the country.</p><p><strong>About OpenFn Group:</strong> Open Function Group (“OFG”) helps health and\nhumanitarian interventions in 40+ countries achieve scale and improve service\ndelivery through automation, data integration, and interoperability solutions.</p>",

Non-technical readers click away when they read the\nformer, while developers see the latter and think it’s nonsense! (i.e.,\nIntegration is NEVER trivial.) This doesn’t leave a lot of you left here on\nsentence number 5. Thanks for sticking it out, and let me reward your patience\nby explaining why this is such a big deal and what we need from you to make it\nhappen.</p><p>By leveraging technology, we can make social programs more effective. Bigger,\nbetter, more complete solutions to issues of poverty, public health, and human\nrights are not only possible, but seem to be right on our doorstep thanks to\ntremendous advances in information technology in the last 25 years. Thousands of\ntools have been developed to address all sorts of needs across international\ndevelopment. While the tools and use-cases vary tremendously, there’s always one\nugly, expensive, technically complex constant lurking in the background.</p><p>(Enter “integration” stage left.)</p><p>Just as “no man is an island”, no single piece of technology can stand alone. We\nrely on integrations every day. Many applications are so tightly integrated that\nwe hardly notice. Gmail and Google Contacts almost behave like a single app. If\nyou’re lucky, Gmail and your calendar are also integrated. If you sync a folder\non your computer to Dropbox, there’s a nifty integration between your local\noperating system and Dropbox.com. All of these integrations save precious time —\nthey cut out a tedious manual step like uploading a copy of each photo you save\non your computer to a website.</p><p>Now imagine running a pediatric HIV clinic in Kenya. Beyond email, a calendar,\nand Dropbox, you rely on a fingerprint scanner to to quickly access patient IDs,\na smart-phone based data collection app for new patient intake during home\nvisits, an electronic medical record system to manage patient data securely, and\nan automated SsocMS service to notify workers and patients of upcoming visits.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"we-should-take-a-moment-to-be-thankful-for-the-progress-weve-made-in-ict4d-its-amazing-that-these-technologies-exist-they-save-time-money-and-lives\">We should take a moment to be thankful for the progress we’ve made in “ICT4D”.

It’s amazing that these technologies exist. They save time, money, and lives.\">​</a></h4><p>The problem is that, for lack of a better metaphor, these technologies all speak\ndifferent languages. You can ask users to download data from one, make sense of\nit, and then upload it to another, but that’s a slow, expensive, and error-prone\ntask. (Not to mention the non-negligible fact that it’s horribly boring.) To get\nthe tos working together automatically you’re talking tens of thousands of\ndollars, and the integration you’re left with isn’t re-usable once your needs\nchange. What’s worse is that every time a new technology is implemented within\nan organization, consultants and developers must struggle anew to integrate it\nwith existing systems because there’s seldom the budget or foresight required to\nbuild a truly flexible and future-proof integration. This is the issue we’re\ntackling, head on.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"openfn-is-a-rosetta-stone-that-makes-automating-the-constant-flow-of-crucial-information-from-one-system-to-another-as-easy-as-point-and-click\">OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.<a href=\"#openfn-is-a-rosetta-stone-that-makes-automating-the-constant-flow-of-crucial-information-from-one-system-to-another-as-easy-as-point-and-click\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.\" title=\"Direct link to OpenFn is a “Rosetta Stone” that makes automating the constant flow of crucial information from one system to another as easy as point-and-click.\">​</a></h4><p>Google.org called OpenFn’s attempt to provide easy and technology agnostic data\nintegration “the holy grail.” Stu, our own chief engineer had the same notion.\nAfter some hard work, it seems that the platform may really be that powerful,\nbut also far more attainable. Here’s how we do it:</p><p>We use (1) a universal standard for data storage, (2) standard information about\nwhat kinds of data are expected from “source applications” and “destination\napplications”, and (3) a user-friendly interface to generate “jobs”—sometimes\ncalled “automation scripts” or instructions for how to process data.</p><h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"a-job-might-be-to-create-a-new-patient-record-when-fingerprints-are-scanned-once-a-job-is-created-it-can-simply-be-switched-on-to-run-in-the-background-while-the-human-beings-at-your-organization-focus-on-much-more-important-and-interesting-things\">A job might be to create a new patient record when fingerprints are scanned.

To integrate a new application,\na small adapter that translates data to JSON and provides a JSON-schema for your\ndatabase is all that’s required. Once one API connection to OpenFn is\nestablished, <strong><em>your technology is instantly connected to every other technology\nconnected to OpenFn–and OpenFn can connect any application.</em></strong> It will start to\nsnowball quickly, allowing data to flow instantly between hundreds of crucial\napplications, and each developer will only ever need to maintain a single\nconnection.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"apps\" src=\"/assets/images/apps-49baedba1e9bb9bdfc57016d05c8c453.png\" width=\"1036\" height=\"582\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>Dozens of organizations worldwide use OpenFn to scale their interventions by\nautomating key processes and information flows.

OpenFn connects any app–including\ncommon ICT4D tools like DHIS2, CommCare, Kobo Toolbox, and Salesforce, as well\nas databases, custom applications, and legacy systems. Drop us a note if you’re\nthinking about how to connect tools at your organization, or if you’re a\ndeveloper and wondering how to get your product connected to other essential\ntools in international development.</p><p>In the end, we’re talking about making it orders of magnitude faster and\nsignificantly less expensive to integrate key technologies. By automating the\nflow of data in social impact organizations we eliminate human error and reduce\nlag time—this means better information in the hands of decision makers, faster.\nAll this leads to one thing: bigger, better, and more complete solutions to some\nof the world's biggest problems.</p><p>If you’d just like some more information about OpenFn and how we help leading\nimpact-first organizations scale their interventions, head over to\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Solution Overviews - OpenFn.</a> To get all the\nlatest OpenFn updates, like us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/openfn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a>\nand follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openfn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter.</a></p>",

While this is an accepted rate in the\ncorporate world where CEOs are accustomed to doubling down, conflicting\npressures and tighter budgets in the social-impact space push the chance of\nfailure even higher. Without good data, decision makers from the field to the\nboardroom are hamstrung. Technology alone is never going to solve social\nproblems, but the inability to get it right has and will continue to sink\npromising development programs. We built <a href=\"http://www.openfn.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">openfn.org</a> to\naddress this problem.</p><h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"heres-the-context\">Here's the context.<a href=\"#heres-the-context\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Here's the context.\" title=\"Direct link to Here's the context.\">​</a></h3><p>Over the last four and a half years,\n<a href=\"http://www.verasolutions.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vera Solutions</a> has been designing and building\ndata systems with Force.com for leading impact-first organizations around the\nworld. We’ve now worked with 125 clients in more than 40 countries. We’ve\nwitnessed our partners transform their organizations with good data systems. “É\numa revolução!” said one staffer at PSI Mozambique. We’ve also gained experience\nwith dozens of other technologies designed to serve social impact organizations.\nThese tools have enabled our partners to improve their operations in diverse\nways ranging from communicating by SMS with thousands of farmers in Mali, to\ncollecting loan repayments using MPESA in Kenya, to analyzing household survey\ndata in India.</p><p>Hundreds of these tools exist, but social impact organizations face three main\nbarriers to successful implementations:</p><ol><li>Picking the right tool is hard.</li><li>Even if you pick the right tool, a successful implementation of that tool\nhinges on solving complex people and process problems.</li><li>No single tool does it all, so you’ve got to figure out how to integrate more\nthan one — and they rarely ‘play nice’.</li></ol><p>Figuring out the people and the processes, that’s always going to be the hardest\npart to get right — whether or not the technical work presents a barrier.\nOpenfn.org’s first objective is to knock down the technical hurdles so that\norganizations can focus on that important contextual stuff.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/assets/images/techpic-3e8124b4f95b5f6dbf743b755804c8f7.jpg\" width=\"2999\" height=\"1999\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p><p>We see a future where the technical setup of a mobile money platform, a\nbiometrics tool, even an offline clinic registration platform, feels just like\ndownloading an app from the app store.</p><p>We’re still a long way from that reality, but we’ve built an\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/pricing#open-source\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">open-core</a> integration platform\nthat’s poised to bring together the “technology for development” landscape with\nclicks, not code.
