Keyboard shortcuts (keystrokes) allow you to perform common actions without
taking your hands off the keyboard. ðŸ¤“

## Platform Shortcuts

| Command                  | Availability      | Mac              | Linux/Windows      | Notes                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Save Workflow            | Canvas, Inspector | `âŒ˜+s`            | `Ctrl+s`           |
| Save & Sync Workflow     | Canvas, Inspector | `âŒ˜+Shift+s`      | `Ctrl+Shift+s`     | When opting to sync, you'll be prompted to either enter a commit message or use the default message provided.                |
| Run                      | Inspector         | `âŒ˜+Return`       | `Ctrl+Enter`       | This will save (but not sync) your workflow and run it from the current step with the default workorder grouping behavior.\* |
| Run _(alternate action)_ | Inspector         | `âŒ˜+Shift+Return` | `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | This will save (but not sync) your workflow and create a new workorder from the current step.                                |

\*If you are viewing an existing work order and create a run from the inspector,
that run will be associated with the existing work orderâ€”this is the default
behavior. (Think of this as "retrying".) Sometimes, for auditing purposes, it's
helpful to create an entirely new work order. This can be done by using the
alternate run button.

## Selected Editor Shortcuts

See the command pallette (right click or press `F1`) for the full list. Note
that to access these shortcuts you must click into a specific editorâ€”there are
multiple editors in the Inspector interface.

| Command              | Availability          | Mac              | Linux/Windows |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| View Editor Commands | Inspector, Run Viewer | `F1`             | `F1`          |
| Format Code          | Inspector             | `Shift+Option+F` | `Shift+Alt+F` |
| Comment Code Out/In  | Inspector             | `âŒ˜+/`            | `Ctrl+/`      |
