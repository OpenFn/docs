This article shows you how to create a personal access API token.

### About API Tokens

OpenFn provides API permission for users to build or interact with their project
on the platform via the API. You need a Personal Access Token to be able to
access the platform via the API. You can find out more about creating or
updating your project programmatically, visit our
[Portability](../deploy/portability.md)
page.

Your API access provides you the same level of permission as you have as a user
on OpenFn (for example, if your profile has Admin level access, your API user
will also have Admin permissions).

### Creating an API token

You can manage your tokens in your User Profile.

   copy it later.
