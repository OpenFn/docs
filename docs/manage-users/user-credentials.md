You can manage all the Credentials you own under the `Credentials` page of your profile. This article, we'll walk you through how to manage and share the Credentials you own across projects.

### All your Credentials in one place

The `Credentials` page of your `User Settings` allows you to add, view, edit or delete the Credentials you own. It is the central place to manage your Credentials across all projects you collaborate on.

For guidance on how to set up a new Credential, head over to our [Manage Credentials](../manage-projects/manage-credentials.md) page.

You can update the name and login details of a Credential after clicking `Edit`.

### Share Credentials

You can also allow multiple projects to have access to a Credential you own.

To add or remove project access, click `Edit` on the Credential you want to share, and choose the project from the dropdown under `Project Access`.

:::info Shared Credentials remain secret

If you share a Credential with a Project, Collaborators of that Project can _use_ the Credential in their Workflows, but they won't be able to see the login details contained.

:::tip

If you want to share the login details contained in the Credential, use a secure sharing protocol like a password manager or an encrypted messaging platform.
