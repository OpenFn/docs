title: Credentials

Credentials are used to authorize connections to external systems. Some Adaptors
will use credentials to fetch meta-data from source and destination applications
and make the job writing process easier.

A Credentials' values can only be viewed or edited by a single user â€” their "owner"
(the user that created that credential). All the collaborators on a Project can
choose from all credentials for the Project when defining a job.

### Create a new Credential

You can create a new Credential while configuring a new Step in your Workflow,
or via the Settings > Credentials page.
[Read this](/documentation/manage-projects/manage-credentials) for more on
managing credentials.

### Understand the app-specific credentials

Check out the dedicated [Adaptor docs](/adaptors) page for your app to inspect
the `configuration schema` and see what credential details will be required to
authenticate with your app (e.g., `username`, `api_key`).

If your app is not listed in the Adaptors section, then inspect your app's API
documentation to see what is required for "authentication". You can then create
a `Raw JSON` Credential in OpenFn to define whatever credential inputs are
required. E.g.:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "someSecretKey",
  "baseUrl": "https://example.com/api/v2"
}
```

Note that some systems (Salesforce, OpenMRS, DHIS2) require an instanceUrl,
host, or ApiUrl. While most adaptors will handle a "trailing slash" in a URL
gracefully, when in doubt you should leave it off. For example:

- prefer `https://login.salesforce.com` to `https://login.salesforce.com/`,
- use `http://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs` instead of
  `http://demo.openmrs.org/openmrs/`,
- and write `https://play.dhis2.org` rather than `https://play.dhis2.org/`.

### Use OAuth2 credentials

If OAuth2 _clients_ have been configured on your OpenFn instance, you can use
them create OAuth credentials:

1. First you pick an OAuth credential type from the "New Credential" interface.
2. Then you give it a name.
3. You optionally select additional "scopes" that you want to use. (See the
   in-app link to third-party documentation on scopes, depending on what
   application you're using.)
4. And then click "Sign in with \_\_\_\_\_\_".

You will be asked by the third-party application to verify your identity and
that you'd like to use OAuth. Once you accept, back on OpenFn you'll be able to
save and use your new credential just like any other.

:::tip

If you're using a deployed instance of OpenFn and can't find the OAuth
credential type for your app, please contact the superuser responsible for your
instance setup and request them to set up OAuth clients for your application.
Users of the hosted OpenFn platform SaaS can post on
[community.openfn.org](https://community.openfn.org) or send an email to
[support@openfn.org](mailto://support@openfn.org).

#### e.g., GoogleSheets OAuth Credential

Note the credential selects only required scopes for Google Sheets.

#### e.g., Salesforce OAuth Credential

Note that you can choose which scopes to access on Salesforce.

### Creating a dedicated "integration user" for your OpenFn workflow

To keep target systems as secure and controlled as possible, we recommend that
credentials used in the integration be granted API-only access to the target
application. 

You _can_ use your personal user as an OpenFn credential for your
workflow, but we recommend that you create a dedicated "OpenFn" integration user
or service account user to access your target applications. For example, in
Salesforce, you can create an API-only user with a special API-only license type
to perform automated tasks and integrations without requiring full user access.

API-only users might not be available in every target system, but many do offer the
creation of user roles that have API-only access permissions, and may allow you
to determine the scopes for which APIs or endpoints users can access. Even when an
API only user is not available in the target system, best practices dictate that an
integration/service user is used for all automation tasks to maintain a secure audit
trail.

API-only access minimizes the risks of data breaches by:

- **Ensuring Traceability**: Accessing with an integration user provides an audit
  trail of who logged in when and what changes were made. For example, if you used
  your personal user login for a system in an integration implementation, it
  would be hard to know if it was YOU, a human, who made a change vs. an
  automated system action via the API user.

- **Minimizing breach impact**: The user can be deactivated if compromised, and log
  in to the frontend with the breached API credential is automatically disallowed,
  limiting attack vectors.

- **Ensuring the principle of least privilege**: Each integration user need only
  have access to the subset of data supporting its specific use case.
