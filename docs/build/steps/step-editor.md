This page outlines how to edit and test Steps in your Workflow using the
Inspector interface.

:::tip

If you're writing jobs on the platform app (Lightning), you can use the
[AI Assistant](/documentation/build/ai-assistant) to help you. You'll find it in
the Inspector.

## Edit & Test Steps via the Inspector

Use the `Inspector` interface on the platform to create, edit, and test Steps.
(If you built your Workflow locally using the CLI, you can edit your Jobs on the
app via this interface.)

To access this interface:

1. Open a Workflow
2. Select a Step you want to edit or test
3. Click the code button `</>` displayed on the configuration panel

For more on how to write custom business logic and data transformation rules in
the `Editor`, see the docs on
[writing Jobs](/documentation/jobs/job-writing-guide) and check out the below
video.

## Run & Test Steps

When running Steps to test the configuration, every Run will have an initial
state (which may contain an `Input`) and results in a final state that will
include `Logs` and an `Output`.

- `Input` - Data (JSON) that is used as the starting Input for a Step to utilise
  in its run. An Input can exist for a Work Order and individual Steps within a
  Run, though it is possible for either to exist without an Input.
- `Output` - Data (JSON) that is created as the Output of a Step's execution. An
  Output can exist for a Work Order and individual jobs within a run, and
  typically contains the data sent to the target app.
- `Logs` - A record generated by the workflow execution engine that details the
  activities performed when running a Workflow or individual Step.

See [Writing Jobs docs](/documentation/jobs/job-writing-guide) for more on
writing custom logic, and see [this article](/documentation/jobs/state) for more
on the concept of "state" when writing Jobs and building OpenFn Workflows.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

From the inspector you can perform certain common actions (e.g., save, run, sync
to github) using keystrokes. Check out the full list of keyboard shortcuts
[here](/documentation/keyboard-shortcuts).
