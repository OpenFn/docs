title: Design your Step
---

Before you can configure an individual Workflow Step, you'll need to design the
entire Workflow and consider which specific tasks, activities, or business logic
will be executed by the individual Step. Read on for a brief overview.

Check out the [Workflow Design](/documentation/design/design-overview) docs for
more details on solution design and links to templates.

In short, to design a Workflow Step, you will need to follow the below list of
actions, and consider summarizing your design specifications in a
[workflow diagram](/documentation/design/design-workflow).

## 1. Determine your Inputs/Outputs

1. What is the Input for this Workflow Step? Consider what is the initial state
   or data _before_ the Step begins.
2. What is the desired Output (i.e., the final state or data _after_ the Step is
   executed)? Consider what you want to send to the target app and/or pass onto
   the next Step in the Workflow.

## 2. Map your data elements

[See here](/documentation/design/mapping-specs) for detailed guidance on mapping
data elements or "data dictionaries" between your source and destination apps.
To get started:

1. Export the metadata (or "form", "field list", or "data elements") of your
   source app (input) & destination app (output).
2. Paste the metadata into an Excel spreadsheet to create a mapping sheet:

![Sample mapping sheet](/img/data-element-mapping.png)

3. Map the source and destinationdata elements & define rules for data cleaning
   and transformation. Consider:

- How should the data collected be translated into your destination system’s
  data model?
- Does your destination system have data input or validation requirements?
- Does the data require transformation or cleaning to satisfy the above answers?

## 3. Define your methods (GET, POST...) and/or operations (insert, update, upsert...)

1. Determine usable existing or create the unique identifiers for your data.
   Unique identifiers are used to insert and update specific records in your
   data (e.g., uuid, form_id, patient_id, etc.).
2. Determine the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) or database operations
   (e.g. insert, update, delete) you want to perform in the target app
3. Check the Adaptor for helper functions.
   - Example from [language-postgresql](/adaptors/packages/postgresql-docs)
     - `insert(...)`, `insertMany(...)`
     - `update(...)`, `updateMany(...)`
     - `upsert(...)`, `upsertMany(...)`  → update if record exists or insert if
       it doesn’t; references an external Id b. Example from
       [language-dhis2](/adaptors/packages/dhis2-docs) using Tracked Entity
       Instances (TEI)
     - `updateTEI(...)`
     - `upsertTEI(...)`

See the below example `Job expression` for a Step that will "upsert" (update or
insert) records in a SQL database.

```js
upsert('mainDataTable', 'AnswerId', {
  AnswerId: dataValue('\_id'), //external Id for upsert
  column: dataValue('firstQuestion)'),
  LastUpdate: new Date().toISOString(),
  Participant: dataValue('participant'),
  Surveyor: dataValue('surveyor'),
  ...
});
```

information.
