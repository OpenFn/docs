## Work Order Status

A `Work Order` is a request to start the execution of an OpenFn Workflow with a
given input (e.g., "complete the referral workflow for patient 123"). A Work
Order is the typically the unit of business value for an organization, because
users want to make sure each workflow request has been processed successfully.

Because administrators may want to run the same Work Order multiple times (e.g.,
"try to complete the referral workflow for patient 123 again now that the
government case management system is back online") the "status" of a Work Order
is determined by the status of the _last_ Run for that Work Order.

I.e., if the "complete the referral workflow for patient 123" Work Order has
been run twice and the first run attempt failed but the second run succeeded,
the "status" for that Work Order will be "success".

## Run Status

Every Run has a status which indicates whether it completed successfully.

### \*Note on error handling within a workflow

Note that if a workflow step fails (e.g., `JobError`, `TypeError`, `RangeError`)
the OpenFn worker will continue processing the workflow as there may be error
handling rules in downstream edges. (E.g., "If step 3 fails, execute step 4.")

If a step fails with a crash (e.g., `Syntax Error`) the worker won't be able to
execute any downstream logic and the whole attempt will be aborted.
