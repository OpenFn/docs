title: History Retention
---

In the "Data Storage" section, you can configure how long you'd like your run
history to be stored for a particular project.

:::tip

Note that when running Lightning on OpenFn.org, a project's plan may limit how
long we'll store your history. You can always store less, but paid plans get
longer storage.

### What is history?

History includes work orders, runs, logs, and any associated input/output
dataclips.

### Why would I want to reduce my history retention period for a project?

Some project administrators chose to store history for a shorter duration (a
month or 90-days) to reduce data storage costs or to limit their data footprint.

### What happens when old work orders, runs, logs, or dataclips get removed?

All history is removed from OpenFn and cannot be accessible on the platform. If
you have previously requested
[work order history exports,](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/manage-projects/io-data-storage?_gl=1*1x5ctqh*_gcl_au*MTE3Njc2MDkyMC4xNzI0MjQzMTAwLjY0NTI0ODAyMC4xNzI3MTY5OTM5LjE3MjcxNjk5NDA.#export-history)
you'll still be able to access exported CSVs via the history export page in
project settings.
