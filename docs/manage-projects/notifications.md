### Email Digests

Also in `Project Settings > Collaboration`, you can choose to receive daily,
weekly or monthly email digests from a project, summarizing successful and
failed runs for each of your workflows.

If you want to adjust your notifications settings and you are a Collaborator on more than 1 Project, then you will need to go to the `Project Settings > Collaboration` page for _each_ Project you belong to.
