Some applications require OAuth as an authentication method for connecting with
third party applications making requests via their APIs. This guide walks you
through how to set up and manage OAuth clients.

### OAuth Authentication

Some applications require [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) as an authentication
method for connecting with third-party applications and making requests via
their APIs. OpenFn allows you to connect with applications using their OAuth
authentication. To use this feature in your OpenFn workflows, you need to set up
OAuth clients and credentials for your instances or projects. This guide walks
you through the management of OAuth clients and credentials.

### Setting up an OAuth client

#### What is an OAuth client and when do I need it?

By setting up OAuth for an application, you authorize OpenFn to connect and
interact with this application within a set of scopes defined by you. For
example, you might set up an OAuth authorization for OpenFn to connect to your
Google Sheets account to read and track changes on your behalf. In this example,
you need to set up an OpenFn client that will represent an instance of OpenFn on
Google and will hold all the permissions OpenFn needs on your behalf. All API
requests and responses are managed through the OpenFn client and authorized by
an authorization token stored by the client.

In most cases, one client setup might be sufficient for one application but
depending on the project requirements and organization policy, several clients
might be set up for one application. These clients might be owned by the same or
different OpenFn users and accessible to different projects.

For every application you need to connect to OpenFn, you need to set up at least
one client for your project(s).

Oauth clients can be set up either on the
[project credentials page](../manage-projects/manage-credentials.md) or the
[user credentials page](../manage-users/user-credentials.md).

### Creating an OAuth client (Super Users)

:::note Currently only users with
[super user privileges](https://docs.openfn.org/documentation/manage-projects/user-roles-permissions#super-user-privileges)
can create and manage OAuth clients. If you're using the OpenFn cloud-hosted
platform SaaS, contact [support@openfn.org](mailto://support@openfn.org) for
assistance adding a new Oauth client. :::

If you have not created a client before or a superuser has not created a client
for the projects/users in the deployment, you will see an empty block with a
button prompting you to create a client as shown below.

![New client](/img/create_new_oauth_client.png)

Alternatively, you will see the list of existing OAuth clients you have access
to. In this case click on the `New credential` button and select
`OAuth client [Advanced]` in the dropdown.

![OAuth dropdown](/img/oauth_dropdown.png)

:::note Make sure you add https://app.openfn.org/authenticate/callback as the
callback URL for the application when enabling OAuth authentication for the
third party application. (Note: You should substitue `https://app.openfn.org/`
with _your_ OpenFn's deployment base URL if you're not using app.openfn.org.)

[Adaptor documentation](./adaptors) for app-specific guidance :::

### Sharing OAuth Clients

A super user has the privilege to share OAuth clients with projects in two ways:

1. Making a client global
2. Sharing with specific projects

They can do this in the OAuth client configuration modal either when creating
the client, or via editing it.

![OAuth edit](/img/oauth_client_edit.png)

#### Making OAuth clients global

When an OAuth client is global, users in the instance can have access to it and
can create credentials from it.

To make a client global, scroll down to `Manage Project Access` section in the
OAuth client configuration modal and select the checkbox
`Make client global (allow any project in this instance to use this client)` and
save changes. All projects on the instance can now access the client and users
with owner, admin and editor rights on these projects can now create credentials
from the client.

#### Sharing OAuth clients with projects

To share an OAuth client with specific projects, scroll down to
`Manage Project Access` section in the OAuth client configuration modal. Select
the project dropdown and select a project and click the add button to grant the
project access to the client.

### Creating a credential from an OAuth client

Every client requires an authentication token to authenticate requests made to
the application on behalf of the user. On OpenFn, these tokens are created as
credentials and are associated with clients.

1. To create a credential from an Oauth client, click on create a new credential
   or click on the button as show below:

![Create new cred](/img/create_new_cred.png)

![New credential](/img/new_cred.png)

:::tip Unlike for OAuth clients, project owners or admins can also create
credentials, not only super users. :::

2. Then, in the credential type modal, find and select the Oauth client to use
   for creating the OAuth credential. This will open a new modal for you to
   configure the credential by providing the name, scopes/permissions required
   and API version.
3. When youâ€™ve filled the form, click on the
   `Sign in with [your OAuth Client name]` button to authorize the Oauth client.
   Clicking this button will open a new tab for you to grant OpenFn an
   authorization token to authenticate your requests.

:::note When you have siged in, you will be required to grant OpenFn access by
clicking `Allow` on the permissions modal. Please note that this might look
different for different applications but the intent is to grant OpenFn
perimission to carry out certain actions to the application on your behalf. The
user authenticating OAuth clients should have the required permissions in the
application. :::

### Deleting Clients and Credentials

To delete a credential/client, simply click `Delete`.

![OAuth edit](/img/oauth_client_edit.png)

A confirmation message pops up to confirm your action.

As soon as you confirm that you want to delete a credential, you will receive an
email to notify you that the credential has been scheduled for deletion.

The scheduled deletion date is set by a grace period configured by your instance
administrator. On the [OpenFn hosted instance](https://app.openfn.org/), it will
be permanently deleted after 7 days.

Go to the docs on
[managing user credentials](../manage-users/user-credentials.md) to learn more
about credential management for the applications you are integrating with on
OpenFn.
