## What is a Project?

A `Project` on OpenFn is a shared workspace for a team or organization that
contains their Workflows, Credentials and Collaborators scoped to that project.

## Managing Projects

We introduced a `Projects` table in `v2.7.14` to help users manage their OpenFn
projects in a table view. This is the new page that you'll see everytime your
login to your OpenFn account. When users click `Projects` in the menu sidebar, 
you will see the list of projects where you have been granted collaborator access.

## Creating a new Project

To create a new Project, follow the following steps:

1. Log in into your OpenFn account or navigate to projects table by clicking
   `Projects` on the breadcrumb if you're in a different project.
2. On the projects table, click on `Create project`. This will open a modal for
   you to provide the details of the project.
3. Enter the `name` and `description` of the new project.
4. For users on cloud-hosted OpenFn, you'll be required to select a
   `billing account` your new project should be billed to.

:::info For cloud hosted users on app.openfn.org

1. Projects in a billing account should have unique names.
2. New projects CANNOT be on a free plan.

## Updating Project Information

You can access your Project's information under `Settings` (see app menu
sidebar). Setup allows you to view or edit the project name and description.

You can also export your entire project "as code" - either to save it, or to
edit your project locally. You can learn more about this feature on our
[Portability page](/documentation/deploy/portability).
