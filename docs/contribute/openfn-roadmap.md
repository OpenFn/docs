## Introduction

This page details the planned roadmaps for the key products in the OpenFn
product suite, including Lightning, Adaptors, and this Docs site. While this
page will be updated periodically, you can track our realtime roadmap and
progress [here](#what-are-we-currently-working-on).

## Our approach to product development

At OpenFn, we follow the [Shape Up approach](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) to
help our small engineering team build _meaningul_ products and features faster
without compomising on quality. With Shape Up in place, we typcially commit to
_projects_ that can be delivered in a 4-6 week period with multiple releases
based on QA approval within the building cycle. We also proiritize feedback and
feature requests from our users over features in the backlog.

:::success Transparency and building what matters

Note that it's fairly rare for us to commit to delivering a specific feature
more than 2 or 3 months in the future. We are committed to constantly evluating
what our user base needs most and spending the few resources we have to deliver
value to them‚Äîwe simply can't guarantee that what sounds like the "7th most
important feature to build" now will still be on our list in 6 months.

At the same time, we strive to be as transparent and inclusive as we can in our
planning processes. We have a big backlog of feature requests and GitHub issues
(bug reports, stubs, even partially shaped epics or projects) that are getting
voted up, commented on, and used as inspiration when we're deciding what to
prioritize next.

Read on to learn more about how we work, how you can see what's coming, and how
you can get involved!

## What are we currently working on?

All of our team's work is tracked publicly using a GitHub Project. Three key
views give you up-to-the-minute insights on what we're doing and what's on our
immediate roadmap.

### See [**_Now_**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/3/views/1) üöß for what's been funded and is currently being built

### See [**_Next_**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/3/views/2) üìù for what's being shaped and _may_ be funded in the next cycle

### See [**_Epics_**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/3/views/7) ü§î for a list of projects that we're considering, roughly-prioritized

### See [**_Bugs_**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/3/views/22) üêû for reported bugs

We will update this site periodically (ideally after each cycle, typically
lasting between 2-6 weeks) to reflect our progress on major items. You can also
keep track of all new features, changes, and bug fixes in our
[Changelog](https://openfn.github.io/lightning/changelog.html).

## How to **get involved**

We use [Canny](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests) to receive, track,
engage and manage new feature requests from the community of users of OpenFn
globally whilst giving users the ability to the upvote their favoritie and
mission critical feature request.

### Upvote features üëç

1. Go to [openfn.canny.io](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests)
2. Scroll down or use the filter and search features to see existing feature
   requests
3. Click on the (^) beside the request to upvote
4. If you want more upvotes for this feature request, share a link to the
   feature with your network

### Request a new feature üí°

1. Go to [openfn.canny.io](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests)
2. Provide a very clear, concise and descriptive title for the feature (e.g.,
   "Make the new workflow button green")
3. Describe the feature request in detail and why it's important to you
4. Share the feature request on the OpenFn community and across your
   professional network for upvotes

:::info Tip

When describing the feature, it is very helpful to help us understand the
problem, proposed solution (if any) and similar solutions we might glean
insights from _if they exist_.

:::

### Open an issue or bug directly

If you prefer the direct approach, you can search across all tracked issues in
OpenFn's GitHub org [here](https://github.com/OpenFn), comment on them, or even
pick them up to work on yourself. If you don't find what you're looking for,
please go ahead an create an issue in the relevant repo. We'll do our best to
respond promptly!

## Summary Roadmaps

#### How to interpret `Status` values in the roadmap

- `Tracked` means we're thinking about this, but it hasn't been
  designed/scoped/shaped
- `Shaped` means it's been scoped and ready to be picked up by an engineer
- `In dev` means it's currently being worked on by an engineer (see
  [_NOW_](#what-are-we-currently-working-on))
- `Delivered` means it's been released (see
  [Changelog](https://openfn.github.io/lightning/changelog.html))

### Lightning Roadmap

OpenFn/Lightning is the fully open-source workflow automation platform at the
core of the OpenFn Digital Public Good (learn more about the product
[here](/documentation#openfn-v2-lightning-)).

### Adaptors Roadmap

OpenFn's open-source adaptors can connect any application, including web APIs,
databases, and even raw data files, enabling interoperability with any
information system ([read more](/adaptors/)). Adaptors, alongside OpenFn's
workflow engine, enable automated workflows that cut across digital systems.
