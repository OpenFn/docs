### Introduction 

This page details the planned roadmaps for the key products in the OpenFn
product suite. This includes Lightning, Adaptors, and Docs. We periodically
review the roadmap to keep it reaser up to date with the development status 
of the features highlighted on the roadmap.


### Our approach to product development
At OpenFn, we have adopted [ShapeUp methodology](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) to help our 
small product and engineeting team build products faster without compomising 
on quality. With ShapeUp in place, we typcially commit to _projects_ that can be delivered 
in a 4-6 weeks period with multiple releases based on QA approval within the building cycle. 
We also proiritize feedback and feature requests from our users over features in the backlog. 

### Feature Requests
We use [Canny](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests) to receive, track, engage and manage 
new feature requests from the community of users of OpenFn globally whilst giving users the 
ability to the upvote their favoritie and mission critical feature request.

#### How to request a new feature
1. Go to [https://openfn.canny.io](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests)
2. Provide a very clear, concise and descriptive title for the feature e.g. Make roadmap avaialble in French
3. Describe this feature in detail
4. Share this new feature request on the OpenFn community and across your professional network for upvotes

:::info Tip

When describing the feature, it is very helpful to help us understand the problem, proposed solution 
(if any) and similar solutions we might glean insights from _if they exist_.

:::

#### How to upvote features
1. Go to [https://openfn.canny.io](https://openfn.canny.io/feature-requests)
2. Scroll down or use the filter and search features to see existing feature requests  
3. Click on the (^) beside the request to upvote. _Upvoted feature requests are prioritized for development_
4. If you want more upvotes for this feature request, you can also share across your network

### Adaptors Roadmap

OpenFn's open-source adaptors can connect any application, including web APIs,
databases, and even raw data files, enabling interoperability with any
information system ([read more](/adaptors/)). Adaptors, alongside OpenFn's
workflow engine, enable automated workflows that cut across digital systems.
