## Introduction

This section is intended to provide developers with a basic introduction to
contributing to OpenFn's open-source applications.

There are three ways you can contribute to the OpenFn DPG: 

### 1. Build or extend OpenFn adaptors

- Requires knowledge of Javascript and Typescript
- See the [README.md](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors#contributing)  to learn how to contribute 

### 2. Add or improve a feature on the OpenFn Lightning platform
- Requires knowledge of Elixir and Pheonix Liveview
- See the [README.md](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning#contribute-to-this-project) to learn how to contribute

### 3. Add to or improve our documentation

Please feel free to point out [issues](https://github.com/openfn/docs/issues)
with the OpenFn documentation or, if you can't find the right repo, issues with the
tools themselves. (The more feedback the better!). If you want to propose some
new language for the documentation, you can make those changes by clicking the
**"Edit this page"** link at the bottom of any page and submit a pull request!
