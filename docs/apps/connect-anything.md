## If you can connect over the web, so can OpenFn.

Connect anything with a REST endpoint or a webhooks service. You can even run
web scraping or browser automation tools with OpenFn. See the
[FAQs](../faqs#can-openfn-integrate-with-my-custom-app) and
[Generic Data Sources](../source-apps) for more info.

## What's in this section?

In the other pages in this section, you'll find guides and documentation for
some of the most common technologies that our users integrate with OpenFn.
