## If you can connect over the web, so can OpenFn.

Connect anything with a REST endpoint or a webhooks service, as well as databases 
(incl. PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL, MongoDB),  or other external data sources (e.g., 
CSVs, JSON files). You can even run web scraping or browser automation tools with 
OpenFn. See the [FAQs](/documentation/faqs#can-openfn-integrate-with-my-custom-app) 
and [Generic Data Sources](/documentation/source-apps) for more info.

It's almost like a universal translator... 🖖
