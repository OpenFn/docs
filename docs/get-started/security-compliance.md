## OpenFn and data storage

In your digital ecosystem, typically **OpenFn serves as a data processing and
transfer solution—not as a data storage service.**

As an open source Digital Public Good, OpenFn can be deployed anywhere and
workflows can be configured to adhere to your organization's specific data
sharing agreements and security policies.

Consult the `Manage Projects` docs pages for more on project and
[data storage settings](../manage-projects/io-data-storage.md).

See the below diagram for an example architecture where even the OpenFn Cloud
can be configured as a **“zero-persistence” data pipeline** to ensure compliance
with data security and residency requirements. This enables partners to rapidly
configure and pilot projects using the turnkey OpenFn cloud-hosted platform,
before migrating to a local deployment when they’re ready to scale.
