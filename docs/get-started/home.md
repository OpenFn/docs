### OpenFn v2: Lightning âš¡

When you hear "OpenFn", think
[OpenFn/lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning/). v2 is a _fully open
source_ workflow automation web application which can be deployed and run
anywhere. It is designed for governments and NGOs who want state-of-the-art
workflow automation and data integration/interoperability capabilities with
fully-fledged user management and auditing capabilities through a managed _or_
entirely self-hosted platform.

Version 2 leverages the same tried-and-trusted core technology as the OpenFn v1
and comes with an improved, visual interface for building integrations.
