## About Claude

[Claude](https://claude.ai/) is an AI assistant built by Anthropic. It provides
a family of large language models (LLMs) developed for natural language
processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and question answering.

Claude models process text input to generate responses but do not have built-in
memory or autonomous decision-making. They can be integrated with external tools
or APIs to execute actions beyond text-based outputs.

## Use OpenFn + LLMs for AI-Driven Workflows

While LLMs (like Claude or ChatGPT) can generate insights, recommendations, or
structured data, they often **lack direct execution capabilities**â€”meaning they
need an automation system to act on their outputs.

**OpenFn workflows fill this gap by orchestrating actions based on LLM-generated responses.**

Remember that LLMs are imperfect. Learn more about your recommended approach to
AI in our [Responsible AI Policy](https://www.openfn.org/ai).

## Integration Options

Use this adpator to integrate with the [Claude API](https://www.anthropic.com/api), to integrate Claude AI models into your workflows to
leverage their natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.
