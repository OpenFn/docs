## Overview

Go.Data ([https://www.who.int/godata](https://www.who.int/godata) is an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during
public health emergencies.

### Integration Use Cases

Check out the Go.Data `Interoperability Toolkit` docs for example OpenFn integrations and related documentation: https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/interoperability/

## Integration Options

Data integration via the Go.Data web API. Two-way integration can be achieved, but see all options here: https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/options/

## OpenFn Adaptor

The open-source [`language-godata`](https://openfn.github.io/language-godata/)
adaptor has been developed with a series of helper functions for common
operations to expedite integration setup.

Also, the generic
[`language-http`](https://github.com/OpenFn/language-http#language-http-) can be
used to make HTTP requests to the Go.Data API and can perform any operations not
supported by `language-godata`.

## Implementation Examples

See Go.Data docs site: https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/integration-scripts/
