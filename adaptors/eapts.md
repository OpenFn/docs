The **@openfn/language-eapts** adaptor enables seamless integration between OpenFn workflows and EAPTS APIs—automating tasks such as:

- Synchronizing stock and dispensing data  
- Validating prescriptions and patient records  
- Generating dashboards or analytics reports  
- Monitoring supply chain performance programmatically

## Use OpenFn + EAPTS for Data-Driven Health Workflows

EAPTS plays a critical role in pharmaceutical inventory control and traceability.  
However, managing cross-system data exchange—such as syncing with DHIS2, KoboToolbox, or Salesforce—can be complex.

**OpenFn workflows bridge this gap**, enabling automated data exchange, real-time validations, and notifications across multiple digital health systems.

Example:
> Use OpenFn to fetch updated stock levels from EAPTS nightly and automatically sync them with your national reporting system.

## Integration Options
