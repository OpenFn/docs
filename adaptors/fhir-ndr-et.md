## Custom FHIR Adaptor: fhir-ndr-et
Note‚ùó: This is a custom adaptor generated from this Implementation Guide `Ethiopia FHIR Implementation Guide - HIV Treatment & Care Services` authored by Jembi Health Systems: https://build.fhir.org/ig/jembi/ethiopia-hiv/branches/master/index.html

Custom FHIR adaptors generate a suite of helper functions specific to their source Implementation Guides.

See the generic [fhir adaptor](/adaptors/fhir) and our [docs on standards](/documentation/get-started/standards) for more general guidance on OpenFn + FHIR.

## Build your own FHIR Adaptor
See the [Adaptors Wiki](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/Generating-Fhir-Adaptors) to build your own adaptor for _your_ implementation guide by trying out our fhir-adaptor-generator (which is a new tool still in testing).
