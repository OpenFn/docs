## Connect _Anything._

First, it's important to note that OpenFn can connect to _any system_ via HTTP,
but our community has also built dozens of "adaptors" to save time & money while
connecting to most commonly used digital public goods and key ICT4D systems.

You can even run web scraping or browser automation tools with OpenFn. It's
almost like a universal translator... ðŸ––

## What's an adaptor?

An adaptor is an open-source Javascript or Typescript module that provides
OpenFn users with a clean set of helper functions that help communicate with a
specific external system. In the past, we often referred to them as "language
packages" and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the
preferred way of communicating about adaptors is as follows:

- "What _**adaptor**_ is that job using?" ("That job is using
  `language-dhis2`.")
- "The DHIS2 _**adaptor**_ is called `language-dhis2`."
- "I don't have the right _**adaptor**_ for this job, let me install it by
  running `npm install @openfn/language-dhis2`.

In short, _most_ adaptors follow the naming convention `@openfn/language-xyz`.

## Adaptors vs. Workflows

Adaptors are reusable components that make connecting with a specific app
easier, whereas [Workflows](/documentation/get-started/terminology#workflow) are
the project-specific processes that you want to automate. OpenFn users will
always leverage Adaptors to better understand how to work with specific APIs, to
access Adaptor helper functions (or "shortcuts") to more quickly build
Workflows, and to handle authenticatio. See the below diagram.

## Where to find Adaptors

<div>
  Here's a list of the {generateList().length} publicly supported OpenFn
  adaptors. Note that only some have been migrated to our new and have their
  docs sites served here. For the rest, you can view the docs and source by
  clicking into the adaptor and choosing your version.
</div>

<div>
  {generateList().map(a => {
    return (
      <details>

### On OpenFn

When creating or editing a job step, you can choose the adaptor to run the job.
This way you "import" the needed operations. Simply open the dropdown list of
adaptors, and click on one.

### On npm

Most of our adaptors are also available on
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

adaptors can be found
