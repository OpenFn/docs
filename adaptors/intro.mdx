## Connect _Anything._

First, it's important to note that OpenFn can connect to _any system_ via HTTP,
but our community has also built dozens of "adaptors" to save time & money while
connecting to most commonly used digital public goods and key ICT4D systems.

You can even run web scraping or browser automation tools with OpenFn. It's
almost like a universal translator... ðŸ––

## What's an adaptor?

An adaptor is an open-source Javascript or Typescript module that provides
OpenFn users with a clean set of helper functions that help communicate with a
specific external system.

An adaptor sits between the OpenFn platform (ie, app.openfn.org) and some
backing service or system (e.g., DHIS2, Salesforce, Postgres).

Its job is to provide a clean, high-level JavaScript interface to uses writing
workflows in OpenFn. Users who write OpenFn job code are usually inexperienced
programmers, and rarely experts in all the systems that a workflow has to
connect with. A good adaptor will make that user's journey easier.

In the past, we often referred to them as "language packages" and the two terms
are sometimes used interchangeably, but the preferred way of communicating about
adaptors is as follows:

- "What _**adaptor**_ is that job using?" ("That job is using
  `language-dhis2`.")
- "The DHIS2 _**adaptor**_ is called `language-dhis2`."
- "I don't have the right _**adaptor**_ for this job, let me install it by
  running `npm install @openfn/language-dhis2`.

In short, _most_ adaptors follow the naming convention `@openfn/language-xyz`.

## Adaptor Badges

OpenFn uses badges to label adaptors based on how they are built and maintained.
The scale being used is:

## Adaptors vs. Workflows

Adaptors are reusable components that make connecting with a specific app
easier, whereas [Workflows](/documentation/get-started/terminology#workflow) are
the project-specific processes that you want to automate. OpenFn users will
always leverage Adaptors to better understand how to work with specific APIs, to
access Adaptor helper functions (or "shortcuts") to more quickly build
Workflows, and to handle authenticatio. See the below diagram.

## Where to find adaptors

<div>
  Here's a list of the {generateList().length} publicly supported OpenFn
  adaptors. Note that only some have been migrated to our new and have their
  docs sites served here. For the rest, you can view the docs and source by
  clicking into the adaptor and choosing your version.
</div>

    return (

            This adaptor hasn't been migrated yet, but it still works just fine

### On OpenFn

When creating or editing a job step, you can choose the adaptor to run the job.
This way you "import" the needed operations. Simply open the dropdown list of
adaptors, and click on one.

<img src="/img/adaptor-picker.webp" />

### On npm

Most of our adaptors are also available on
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

![Adaptors list in npm](/img/adaptor_npm.webp)

## Don't see an adaptor for your app?

Explore our "universal" adaptors that support a wide variety of protocols, such
as:

- [HTTP](/adaptors/packages/http-docs)
- [SFTP](/adaptors/packages/sftp-docs)

Or build your own (see below)!

## Building and extending adaptors

See the [Github Adaptors wiki](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki) for the
technical guide to developing adaptors.

Adaptors' source code and technical documentation for developing or extending
existing adaptors can be found on this linked repository:
