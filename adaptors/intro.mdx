## Connect _Anything._

First, it's important to note that OpenFn can connect to _any system_ via HTTP,
but our community has also built dozens of "adaptors" to save time & money while
connecting to most commonly used digital public goods and key ICT4D systems.

You can even run web scraping or browser automation tools with OpenFn. It's
almost like a universal translator... 🖖

## What's an adaptor?

An adaptor is an open-source Javascript or Typescript module that provides
OpenFn users with a clean set of helper functions that help communicate with a
specific external system. In the past, we often referred to them as "language
packages" and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but the
preferred way of communicating about adaptors is as follows:

- "What _**adaptor**_ is that job using?" ("That job is using
  `language-dhis2`.")
- "The DHIS2 _**adaptor**_ is called `language-dhis2`."
- "I don't have the right _**adaptor**_ for this job, let me install it by
  running `npm install @openfn/language-dhis2`.

In short, _most_ adaptors follow the naming convention `@openfn/language-xyz`.

## Where to find them

<div>
  Here's a list of the {generateList().length} publicly supported OpenFn
  adaptors. Note that only some have been migrated to our new and have their
  docs sites served here. For the rest, you can view the docs and source by
  clicking into the adaptor and choosing your version.

### On OpenFn

When creating or editing a job step, you can choose the adaptor to run
the job. This way you "import" the needed operations. Simply open the dropdown
list of adaptors, and click on one.

### On npm

Most of our adaptors are also available on
[npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

![Adaptors list in npm](/img/adaptor_npm.png)

<!-- NOTE that this functionality doesn't exist yet on Lightning -->
<!-- #### Install on platform via npm

When using `platform`, you can install adaptors that are not part of the
recommended adaptors picklist directly from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn).

To install from npm, click on the _cloud download icon_ next to the adaptor
version picklist. In the **Select Unreleased Adaptor** dialog box, enter the
`adaptor name`(e.g. `dhis2` for `language-dhis2`) and the corresponding
`version number`(e.g. `v2.3.4`), as listed on
[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40openfn), for the adaptor of your
choice. The platform will attempt to install the selected adaptor version it can
be used to run the specified job.

Note that, after this custom installation of the adaptor, `platform` will not
add this adaptor version to the picklist of recommended adaptors in
[Inspector](../build/steps/step-editor.md), but you are guaranteed that the
adaptor will be available to use in any of your jobs as long as you specify it
via the **Select Unreleased Adaptor** dialog. -->
