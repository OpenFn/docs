## About Varo

[Varo](https://www.varo-app.org/) is a simple and free smartphone app that
collects and forwards useful cold chain information and temperature logs to the
email inbox of your choice.

## Integration Options

This is a data transformation adaptor for converting Varo data to the WHO
Equipment Monitoring System (EMS) standard.

To integrate with Varo data, you can use the relevant OpenFn adaptor (e.g.,
Gmail) for your chosen email inbox to query the Varo emails and attachments.
