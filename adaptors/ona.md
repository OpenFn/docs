## Webhooks to push form data to OpenFn

Ona has a great
[knowledge base article](https://help.ona.io/knowledge-base/how-do-i-configure-webhooks/)
that walks users through webhook creation.

1. To push data from Ona.io, click on the drop-down menu next to a specific form
   and select `Settings`.
2. On the left-side menu, select `Webhooks`.
3. Paste your OpenFn inbox URL into the URL input field.
4. Click "Add webhook".
5. Ensure that the webhook is now listed with the `JSON` tag, indicating that it
   will forward data as JSON.
6. Check to see that, once a form is submitted, it is forwarded to your OpenFn
   inbox.
