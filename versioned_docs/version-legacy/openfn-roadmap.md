## OpenFn Roadmap

This page details the planned roadmaps for the key products in the OpenFn
product suite. This includes OpenFn/`Lightning`, `Adaptors`, and `Docs`.

### Key for the Roadmap `Status` Values

| Status Value  | Definition                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Not started` | Issue in the backlog but still in need of being designed and scoped out |
| `Planned`     | Scoped and ready to be picked up by an engineer                         |
| `In dev`      | Currently being worked on by an engineer                                |

### Lightning Roadmap

OpenFn/Lightning is the fully open-source workflow automation platform at the
core of the OpenFn Digital Public Good (learn more about the product
[here](/documentation#openfn-v2-lightning-)).

| 1. Delete a project (as a project owner or a superuser)                | Delivered    | Q2 '23              | [Github issue 757](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/757) & [issue 746](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/746)                                                    | Project owners can delete a project. This will schedule the project for deletion after the configured time period. Also, superusers can schedule a project for deletion, cancel a project's deletion and delete a project immediately.                  |
| 2.

This is similar to 'message filters' in OpenFn platform (v1)                                                                                                                  |

### Adaptors Roadmap

OpenFn's open-source adaptors can connect any application, including web APIs,
databases, and even raw data files, enabling interoperability with any
information system ([read more](/adaptors/)). Adaptors, alongside OpenFn's
workflow engine, enable automated workflows that cut across digital systems.

| 1. Enhancements to [`FHIR`](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/) & [`OpenHIM`](http://openhim.org/) adaptors | Not Started  | Q3 2023             | See existing adaptors for [FHIR](/adaptors/packages/fhir-docs) and [OpenHIM](/adaptors/packages/openhim-docs) | To rebuild the existing 2021 [OpenFn Instant-OpenHIE reference demo](/documentation/get-started/standards#openhie-standard-architecture) to highlight the exchange of data between existing non-FHIR digital health tools and a HAPI FHIR server. (OpenFn Lightning is OpenHIE-compliant and can be used as a workflow engine for the OpenHIE Interoperability layer - [learn more here](/documentation#openfn-v2-lightning-#standards-and-compliance-matter).) We also want to demonstrate data exchange between existing non-FHIR digital health tools and key components of Google’s [Open Health Stack](https://developers.google.com/open-health-stack) and [Cloud Healthcare API](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare-api/docs/concepts/fhir) |
