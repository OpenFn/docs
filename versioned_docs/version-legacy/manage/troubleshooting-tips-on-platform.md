## Runs

One of the most helpful pages for troubleshooting on OpenFn platform is the
[Activity History](/documentation/legacy/getting-started/terminology#activity-history).
This pages provides a list of all of the runs executed in a project and always
marks any failed runs red or yellow. Project administrators can troubleshoot
errors by clicking into the run to review the run details. Keep reading for all
the important parts of a run and how to leverage them during your
troubleshooting!

### Exit codes

Every run will have an exit code. The exit code is a way for OpenFn to classify
the run status and can help you troubleshoot errors. Learn more about OpenFn
exit codes and what each one means [here](../jobs/errors.md).

### The time it took for the job to fail

The run will also record how long it took before the job failed. This
information helps users understand if the job is taking longer than it should
and is especially helpful with errors that involve timeouts. You can use the run
to determine at which operation the job is timing out and determine if the job
performance can be optimized.

### Run logs

As jobs are developed it is important to log details which will make testing and
troubleshooting much easier in the future. Keep reading for the two most
important parts of a run log!

#### Mappings

The logs should be written so that you can see exactly what was mapped between
the source system and the destination system. In cases where data received from
the source system is _not_ being posted to the OpenFn inbox (often for security
reasons), it can even be helpful to log the data that was received. In summary,
the log can have a **"Data received from source system"** section and a **"Data
to be uploaded to destination system"** section.

These logs can help admins verify that the source data and the data being
uploaded to the destination system is correct. For example, seeing in the logs
that that a unique identifier is being mapped to `undefined` in the destination
system can help you understand this Salesforce error message:

`METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED: HTTP Method 'PATCH' not allowed. Allowed are GET,HEAD,POST at HttpApi.getError`.

#### Error messages

The run log should also tell us if an error has been thrown, and depending on
the destination system, what the error message is. Sometimes the error message
is very specific like:

`NOT_FOUND: Provided external ID field does not exist or is not accessible`

This error from Salesforce usually indicates that `External ID` has not been
checked in the field settings in Salesforce.

Other error messages are not as clear and can take some time to debug:

`TypeError [Error]: Cannot read property 'split' of undefined`

**`TypeErrors`** usually indicate that the job received a part of the message
that it wasn't expecting, or there is a syntax error in your job code. It means
that the job needs to be updated to know how to handle the message. In this
case, the job received an old version of the Commcare form which was missing a
field which the job called the `split` function on. You can determine this by
reviewing the job for which fields the split function is being called on and
checking that they are all present in the message.

The more you test and troubleshoot with a particular system, the more familiar
with it's error messages you become.

:::tip

OpenFn has outlined several of the more common error messages specific to some
of the systems that we have integrated in the past. Explore these systems and
their error messages [here](/adaptors#connect-anything).

## Leveraging search and filtering in OpenFn

Leverage the various search functionalities in OpenFn to find the right messages
and runs to support your troubleshooting. You can search in the Inbox, Activity
History, and Search Console.

1. **[Inbox](/documentation/legacy/manage/platform-mgmt#inbox)** - The inbox contains
   all the messages that have been sent to your project. Search your project
   inbox for messages that contain a specific body text. You can also filter
   these messages by date, run status and trigger. You can even use filtering to
   see all the messages whose last run failed, so you can get to
   troubleshooting! Learn more about inbox filtering
   [here](/documentation/legacy/manage/platform-mgmt#inbox).

2. **[Activity history](/documentation/legacy/getting-started/terminology#activity-history)** -
   As discussed above, the activity history records all runs for the current
   project. It has similar search and filtering capabilities as the inbox except
   it doesn't require valid JSON in the search box. Use the search in activity
   history instead of inbox when you want to search **_run logs_** instead of
   messages.

3. **[Search console](./platform-mgmt.md#search-console)** -
   The search console will search in both message bodies **_and_** run logs for
   any string is entered!

## Bulk reprocessing

Sometimes you'll see several messages in the inbox whose last run failed because
of the same error. Once you have resolved the error, you can test it by
rerunning the transaction for one failed run. If this passes, you can then
leverage **bulk reprocessing** in the OpenFn inbox and activity history to
reprocess all messages in the current filtered query. This means OpenFn will
rerun all of those transactions in the order they were received. Learn more
about bulk reprocessing
[here](./platform-mgmt.md#bulk-reprocess-messages).

Sometimes you'll have so many messages with failed runs that it will be
virtually impossible to open each one and inspect the run logs. In this case,
you can resolve the errors and bulk reprocess as you go, each time reducing the
number of failures in the inbox and generating a short list of the remaining
errors.

## Other tips

- **Posting messages to the inbox** - You can post messages directly to the
  OpenFn inbox by clicking the **plus** icon on the bottom left of the inbox.
  This feature can come in handy when you have lengthy messages which include
  several rows of data. You simply copy and paste one row of data from the
  original message to a new message and post it to the inbox. This allows you to
  troubleshoot individual rows of data.
- **Editing messages** - Messages in the inbox can be edited by clicking the
  pencil icon in the message. This is a quick way to update and test any mapping
  fixes with data that is already in the inbox. Once you verify that the run for
  the updated message passes, you can make the appropriate updates to the source
  sytem and post the correct data to the inbox moving forward.
- **Organizing error messages** - When working with various different jobs and
  error messages, it is helpful to organize all errors in a spreadsheet which
  links to the last run, error, and status.

## Sign up for email alerts

You can turn on notifications to receive email alerts when a job fails. When you
receive an error email, you can click “inspect & take action” to be taken to the
failed run and being troubleshooting!

> `external ID`?

Great question, and don't worry, it happens all the time. Assuming you've
already taken all possible measures to either pre-load external IDs in your ODK
form or use more human-proof IDs (like barcodes and fingerprints) here's the
flow of work:

1. Read the email, and inspect the reason for failure.

2. 99% of failed runs on OpenFn are due to `value mismatches`. The _collected_
   `id` in ODK doesn't match the _expected_ `id` in Salesforce. You must now
   chose to either:

   A. Edit the source `id` in your `receipt` & retry the attempt.

   B. Edit the related `id` in your destination system & retry the attempt.

   C. Ignore the attempt—this source data will never reach your destination
   system. (There have been reports of ODK Aggregate's JSON publisher sending
   duplicate values. If that happens and your run fails due to "duplicate
   values" on a particular unique field you can safely ignore the run in
   OpenFn.)

Editing data in your destination system can be done through that system's
interface. Many tools that act as `sources` (like ODK) do not allow for easy
editing and re-submission of data. You can use OpenFn to edit the source data
before retrying the attempt.

### Common Error Messages

The most common error messages with English explanations are:

```sh
DUPLICATE_VALUE: duplicate value found: ODK_uuid__c duplicates value on record with id: a0524000005wNw0
The insert is blocked because you are attempting to create a new record with a
unique field with the same value as an existing record.
```

```sh
Required value missing
```

```sh
ExternalId not found
```

```sh
{ INVALID_FIELD_FOR_INSERT_UPDATE: Unable to create/update fields: Contact__c.
Please check the security settings of this field and verify that it is
read/write for your profile or permission set. }
```

This last one may arise if a master-detail relationship in Salesforce is not set
as reparentable and the user attempts to run an upsert.
