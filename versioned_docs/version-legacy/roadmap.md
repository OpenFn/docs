around the open source integration toolkit. Visit the documentation roadmap on
GitHub to see what we're working on.

Visit
[**the documentation roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/1?card_filter_query=repo%3Aopenfn%2Fdocs)
to view the documentation roadmap.

Below is merely a static list that will be updated far less frequently than the
actual docs issues on GitHub.

:::

## Planned Sections/Enhancements

### Foundational Concepts

A page or set of pages that reviews concepts that are essentially prerequisite
to using OpenFn or another interoperability platform.

### The anatomy of an integration (title subject to change)

Envisioned as a primarily visual page that outlines the constituent parts of
every integration to equip OpenFn users with a solid grounding of what an
integration really is

### Integrating using OpenFn

Either a subpage of the structure page or its own page subsequent to; this maps
the foundational concepts above to jobs, triggers, runs, etc. We will only
introduce OpenFn-specific terminology after we establish a common frame of
reference. In some ways this is just an edit of the current Getting Started
page.

### What Does it Mean to be Ready?

Detail our OFG consulting team’s implementation process, including the various
places that data mapping is referenced to do a step-by-step “pre-job-writing”
walkthrough

### Creation of documentation/tutorial “pathways”

Presenting guides and for new users and new devs from existing documentation
resources to flatten the learning curve

### Quickstart

Rewrite to be dev-centered; should read as a page for users who understand the
above already and are ready to dive into technical setup

### Project walk-through

Revise to incorporate the below app-specific tutorials in a cohesive manner

### How to integrate CommCare with Salesforce

The Project walkthrough, but specific to these two tools.

### How to integrate DHIS2 and CommCare

### How to integrate Kobo Toolbox and a custom Postgres database
