## What is OpenFn?

:::tip

OpenFn is software that makes it easier for governments and NGOs to _connect_
the different technologies they use, share data securely, drive critical
business processes, and scale their interventions via workflow automation and
real-time interoperability.

:::

OpenFn is a suite of data integration, interoperability, and business process
automation (i.e., workflow) tools that's used by governments, NGOs, and social
enterprises in the health and humanitarian sectors. It enables users to connect
any system, and comes with adaptors (i.e. connectors) for
[over 70 apps](https://www.openfn.org/apps).

Some OpenFn use cases are:

## Who is it built by?

OpenFn products are built by the [Open Function Group](../about.md) and
a growing community of open-source contributors.

## Our products

OpenFn has several products, which are all fully interoperable. This gives our
users the freedom to switch between any and all of the OpenFn products.

All OpenFn products, other than the OpenFn iPaaS are part of the free and
open-source
[**OpenFn Integration Toolkit**](/documentation/legacy/getting-started/integration-toolkit).
This Toolkit is a **Digital Public Good** (a "DPG") recognized in the
[DPG Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) and Digital Square's
[Global Goods Guidebook](https://digitalsquare.org/resourcesrepository/global-goods-guidebook).

### OpenFn v1

[OpenFn](https://www.openfn.org/signup) v1 is an
_integration-platform-as-a-service_ or "iPaaS". It is enterprise-grade software,
hosted by OpenFn. We recommend starting out there - you can
[create an account for free](https://www.openfn.org/signup), or view our pricing
[here](https://openfn.org/pricing).

### OpenFn v2: Lightning âš¡

[OpenFn/Lightning](https://github.com/OpenFn/lightning/) is a _fully open
source_ workflow automation web application which can be deployed and run
anywhere. It's the v2 of our digital public good. It is designed for governments
and NGOs who want state-of-the-art workflow automation and data
integration/interoperability capabilities with fully-fledged user management and
auditing capabilities through a managed _or_ entirely self-hosted platform.

Lightning relies on the same tried-and-trusted core technology as the OpenFn
iPaaS and comes with an improved, visual interface for building integrations.

:::info OpenFn/Lightning is now in beta

Lightning is in beta, but will be validated for production use and publicly
released in the second half of 2023.
