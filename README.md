This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static
website generator that uses Markdown and Javascript.

- To create new docs pages, add markdown files (or JS files) to the `/docs`
  folder.
- To view those new pages via the navigation, add links to them in the header,
  footer, or sidebars.
- Note that page ids (which are required in `sidebar.js` are _either_ set
  explicitly _or_ automatically generated by docusaurus as the filename, sans
  extension.)

```sh
./sidebars.js
./sidebars-adaptors.js
./docusaurs.config.js
```

## Local Development

### Installation

#### Unix-like systems

```console
asdf install
corepack enable
asdf reshim nodejs
yarn install
```

#### Windows

Install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Make sure
your `node` version matches the one specified in `.tool-versions`.

### Starting your docs site server

```console
yarn start
```

This command builds the Adaptor docs from
[OpenFn/adaptors](https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors), starts a local
development server, and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected
live without having to restart the server.

### Start without rebuilding adaptor docs

```
yarn start-offline
```

This command skips the adaptor docs step, which requires an active internet
connection.

### Building the job library

```
yarn generate-library
```

This command pulls public job data from OpenFn.org to create a local "job
library".

### Building the adaptors docs from the monorepo

```
yarn start:dev
```

This will first generate adaptors from your monorepo, then launch the server.

You can trigger a rebuild with:

```
yarn generate-adaptors -m
```

Where `-m` means "build from the monorepo.

To automatically rebuild whenever docs.json changes, run `generate-adaptors`
with watch mode:

```
yarn generate-adaptors -w
```

Ensure that the OPENFN_ADAPTORS_REPO env var is set and points to the local
monorepo.

See
(github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/How-to-test-docs-changes)[https://github.com/OpenFn/adaptors/wiki/How-to-test-docs-changes]
for more details

### Build and serve for full-featured testing

```console
yarn generate-adaptors
yarn generate-library
yarn build
yarn serve
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Builds to `main` will automatically be deployed to
[docs.openfn.org](https://docs.openfn.org). This branch is protected, but we
welcome pull requests!
