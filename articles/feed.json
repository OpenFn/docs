            "content_html": "<p>In order to ensure that Global Goods and Digital Public Goods can enable impact\nwithout doing any harm, it is crucial that their authentication and\nauthorization systems are secure from the outset.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a resource to help other Digital Public Goods and Global\nGoods achieve just this. You can view and comment on the resource\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvOcOdk2iZCWnAVNiBbmhh-6Q2gapUhsMCUzJQNWqEU/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">here</a>,\nor read on to learn why.</p>\n<p>Digital health technologies have a critical role to play in both improving the\ndelivery of health services <em>and</em> making health systems more robust and\nadaptable. Whilst this has been the consensus for a while, various factors such\nas bureaucracy, lack of capacity, authority/ownership, budget or simply lack of\nprioritization have hindered the adoption and implementation of such\ntechnologies.</p>\n<p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought digital health systems back to the\ntop of the agenda, having forced governments to adapt their health systems and\nprocesses in a short amount of time and confronted them with the fragility and\ninflexibility of some of their existing systems. This has led to an increase in\nfunding for both new and existing health technologies.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the recent pandemic also saw an increase in data breaches and\ndata leaks in the healthcare sector. Whilst these are a serious matter in any\nsystem, the nature of the healthcare technologies means that the data they are\nstoring or managing almost always includes Personally Identifiable Information\n(PII) which, if leaked, can have dramatic consequences for those they identify.</p>\n<p>The higher the number of technologies and quantity of data stored in these, the\nhigher the risk of vulnerabilities and negative impact of a data breach or data\nleak. If Global Goods are to make the most of this renewed interest and increase\nin funding for digital health technologies, it is crucial for them to keep\nsecurity as a top priority to ensure that they ‘do no harm’, a\ncore<a href=\"https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\"> Digital Public Good</a> principle.</p>\n<p>Several organizations have already put some thought into documenting security\nbest practices and standards. However, none situate these security decisions\nwithin the wider context of a product development timeline or roadmap. This\nrequires individuals to regularly scan through long lists of security\nrecommendations to pick out and prioritize their implementation, increasing the\nlikelihood of an oversight or early-made product decisions which make it harder\nto implement such security features down the line.</p>\n<p>As product manager at Open Function Group, I myself have recently been reviewing\nand analyzing numerous resources to identify and prioritize features required to\nget to fully-secure authentication and authorization for our newest product\n<a class=\"\" href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/documentation#openfn-v2-lightning-/\">Lightning</a>–and make sure that nothing\nfalls through the cracks. I’ve also had the opportunity to gather insights from\nDigital Public Good community forums (OpenMRS, DHIS2, OpenLMIS, etc) and speak\nto other product managers and engineers from the Digital Public Goods community\nto ask them about their learnings, and any tips they might have: Austin and\nMorten from DHIS2, Dev and Biyeun from Dimagi.</p>\n<p><strong>To more widely share these learnings, we have drafted this resource\ndocumenting the specific security measures that should be considered at each\nstage of product development _specifically with regards to authentication and\nauthorization. _</strong>Our hope is that this article will help other product managers\nin the Global Good (GG) and Digital Public Good (DPG) communities consider these\nfeatures into their backlog/roadmap from the outset and make sure they are\nfollowing a ‘secure by design’ approach. To inform our analysis, we analyzed\nlearnings from the wider DPG community, as well as recommendations from other\nsecurity experts and international standards, including GovStack, OpenHIE,\nOWASP, NIST, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>The resource can be found\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvOcOdk2iZCWnAVNiBbmhh-6Q2gapUhsMCUzJQNWqEU/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">here</a>.</strong></p>",

A prescription SMS notification feels seamless, but it\nprobably requires complex automation across multiple systems like clinical\nregistries, pharmacy stock databases, and SMS gateways. Tools like OpenFn run\n“behind the scenes” to perform calculations and transfer relevant data to/from\ndifferent systems autonomously, minimising the risk of human error and\nultimately saving time and money that an agency would spend on manual data\ntransfers. The goal is to preserve data integrity, uphold data security, and\nenforce compliance with policies and data standards.</p>\n<p>Since 2014, OpenFn has been at the forefront of workflow automation in the\nsocial sector, providing a platform to help governments and NGOs focus on the\nhuman aspect of their work rather than wasting time trying to exchange data\nbetween systems or perform calculations manually.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"myagro\">MyAgro<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2022/06/07/workflow-automation#myagro\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to MyAgro\" title=\"Direct link to MyAgro\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.myagro.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">MyAgro</a>, an NGO helping West African farmers increase\ntheir yield, uses OpenFn to power its SMS-based savings deposit system for\nsmall-scale farmers. MyAgro distributes and tracks saving vouchers using the\n<a href=\"https://www.dimagi.com/commcare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">CommCare</a> app. Smallholder farmers purchase\npre-paid myAgro saving scratch cards and text the one-time code to secure the\nvoucher credit in their account. Once the amount has been added to their\nbalance, a confirmation notification is sent to the farmer. MyAgro works with\nthe farmers to reach their savings goal, which they then use to pay for seeds,\nfertilisers, and training courses. OpenFn:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105651463/172341045-62a3eebd-98fb-4189-987f-06bbdb03ac30.png\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\">Syncs voucher codes from CommCare to Salesforce so the relevant offices can\ntrack who purchased the saving vouchers.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Matches incoming SMSs against the database of vouchers to deposit correct\nfunds into the individual account.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Allocates savings to farmers’ accounts in Salesforce and updates the account\nstatus.</li>\n<li class=\"\">Sends a confirmation SMS with updated account balances to farmers, so they\nare aware of their credit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OpenFn helps myAgro reach more farmers with less administrative overhead by\nautomating these key steps.

JavaScript method that <strong>helps us iterate on\narrays to manipulate elements and return values.</strong> The <code>.filter()</code> method is\nbeing used to return a new array after filtering out certain elements from the\noriginal array. We have declared two variables to store the new arrays:\n<code>participantsToUpdate</code> and <code>participantsToCreate</code>. Participants whose ids are\nexisting in the destination system (or who are in the <code>idList</code> array) are added\nto <code>participantsToUpdate</code>, and any remaining participants are added to\n<code>participantsToCreate</code>. This filtering helped us perform the correct operations\non each participant type. For instance, later in the job, we use the filtered\narrays to only overwrite a participant's <code>reportNumber</code> field if it is a new\nparticipant. <code>.filter()</code> is just one of many higher-order functions that power\nOpenFn jobs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"objects--job-mappings\">Objects &amp; job mappings<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/29/how-learning-javascript-helped-me-better-understand-jobs#objects--job-mappings\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Objects &amp; job mappings\" title=\"Direct link to Objects &amp; job mappings\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The final lesson was on objects and key-value pairs--something used in almost\nevery OpenFn job!

And so unit\ntesting, in this case, would refer to \"component testing\", which may be\nconfusing at times, especially when the concept of unit testing is again applied\nto testing functions such as Redux <code>reducers</code> and <code>action creators</code> or any other\nJavaScript function in your application.</p>\n<p>The other challenge that I often faced was whether to write tests for each\ncomponent in isolation or write a test for a feature that encapsulates a set of\nrelated components. The later would be equivalent to writing what I would call\n\"integration tests\".</p>\n<p>Finally, one would say \"well then you could have just written the tests in a way\nthat resemble the way the application is used\"!

This is because React components are built around\nfeatures such as <code>&lt;Signup /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Search /&gt;</code>, etc. So one React component can\nbe a mix of other components to achieve a UI feature set.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>To test a component, write an <strong>integration test</strong> that covers the use of a\ngiven component for a given UI feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>If a component being tested dispatches a Redux <code>action</code>, this is the right\nplace to test those actions and their effect on the UI.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>Pay attention to the concept of <em>feature isolation</em> vs <em>component isolation</em>\nas it will help you write better integration tests and also easily mock\ncomponent contexts.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>A classic example of <strong>feature isolation</strong> is when you have a <code>&lt;UserList /&gt;</code>\ncomponent which displays a list of users and has a <code>&lt;button /&gt;</code> to add a new\nuser. Writing a test for <code>&lt;UserList /&gt;</code> would be equivalent to testing a\nfeature.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>In this example, one would be tempted to test the action of clicking on the\n<code>&lt;AddUserButton /&gt;</code> and further test the <code>&lt;NewUser /&gt;</code> form... nope! This is\nwhere we draw the line! Only test that the <code>&lt;UserList /&gt;</code> renders the mock\n<code>users</code> in the list and that the <code>&lt;AddUserButton /&gt;</code> is present/enabled. The\n<code>&lt;UserList /&gt;</code> feature ends there, otherwise you will be sliding into\n<strong>End-to-End</strong> testing :)! The <code>&lt;User /&gt;</code> component, although it is invoked by\n<code>&lt;UserList /&gt;</code> component, it is isolated enough to be tested in its own\nintegration test.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>Testing components this way would make \"context mocking\" easier for\ncomponents.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>Another important benefit for isolating testing context, as in the example\nabove, is that it will be easier to mock the <code>redux actions</code> and/or api calls\nusing tools such as <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Jest</a> and\n<a href=\"https://mswjs.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">Mock Service Worker</a> (or \"msw\") as explained in the\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/22/testing-react-app-with-jest-hound#choosing-testing-tools\" class=\"\">Choosing Tools</a> section.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>The value of writing integration tests for components, in this way, ensures\nthat a given component renders the UI consistently, given all possible\ncombinations of contexts and interactions. This will also allow you to ensure\nredux actions invoked by the component are called as expected and with the\ncorrect arguments.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>An example component integration test

Our front-end\ntoolchain, albeit far from out of date (Webpack <code>5.52.1</code> today) has left some\nroom for improvement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a post written on what we call 'Slow Fridays', where we explore and\nthink about stuff we're curious about. The deal is some artifact at the end of\nthe day. So while this post is not complete - I believe part two is warranted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Phoenix 1.6 started to include esbuild by <a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/15/webpack-to-esbuild-part1#ref1\" class=\"\">default</a>. The main reasons\ncited were the amount of support the team had to continuously give for a\ntoolchain that although necessary is not under the control of the framework\nteams control.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, Phoenix used brunch to do front end builds - despite not being\nthe most common bundler at the time. The objective I assume was to provide\nsomething that is easy to get going with and lowers the barrier to entry for\nPhoenix. We actually switched brunch out for webpack before webpack got into\nPhoenix in order to more easily use new libraries and newer ES syntax.</p>\n<p>It wasn't without its challenges, and still is. Webpack is wonderfully\npowerful - but it does do <em>a lot</em>, and it's really easy to stumble onto plugins\nthat are either order dependent or mutually exclusive.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"so-whats-this-about-esbuild\">So what's this about esbuild<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/15/webpack-to-esbuild-part1#so-whats-this-about-esbuild\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to So what's this about esbuild\" title=\"Direct link to So what's this about esbuild\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>It's a bundler/compiler for JS/TS projects that is written in Go, along with\nbeing faster by the simple fact it's natively compiled it also leverages\nconcurrency. To compare <em>why</em> esbuild is faster than NodeJS on face value is\nunfair in my opinion. Although having similar objectives, they are wildly\ndifferent in implementation and in features.</p>\n<p>So <strong>speed</strong> is the big selling point. But thinking back to other bundlers, what\nmade us switch (thinking of gulp, grunt, mixing in babel, browserify etc). Those\nchanges were never about speed, at least a drop in build time was nice - a bit of\ncaching goes a long way.

            "content_html": "<p>So you're using docker's multi-stage builds and noticed that your build times\naren't nearly as quick as you expected?</p>\n<p>As many teams who spend more and more time using docker, it's quite common to\nget into multi-stage builds; usually resulting in significantly smaller images.</p>\n<p>However this comes with a pretty significant dilemma with caching. Even when\nusing the <code>--cache-from</code> flag when building, docker only caches the last image.</p>\n<p>One proposed solution<sup><a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/08/improving-multistage-docker-builds-using-buildx#ref1\" class=\"\">1</a></sup>, is to pull, build and push each\nindividual stage. Coming with tight coupling between the shape of your\nDockerfile and your build process/scripts.</p>\n<p>The other solution uses Docker Buildx which the document describes as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Docker Buildx is a CLI plugin that extends the docker command with the full\nsupport of the features provided by Moby BuildKit builder toolkit. It provides\nthe same user experience as docker build with many new features like creating\nscoped builder instances and building against multiple nodes concurrently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While that sounds pretty cool, it doesn't really touch on caching. This actually\ntook me a while to find out that it would in fact do caching very differently.\nIn fact it's a very different experience using it, and has lots of really cool\nfeatures that further detach you from the local docker state allowing you to\nbuild in environments that are stateless - such as Google CloudBuild without\nhaving to wire up some kind of persistence or file caching scheme.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"buildx\">Buildx<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/08/improving-multistage-docker-builds-using-buildx#buildx\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Buildx\" title=\"Direct link to Buildx\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>We're only going to scratch the surface of Buildx, and with that let's get the\nabsolute minimum working; build our image locally.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"local-cache\">Local Cache<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/08/improving-multistage-docker-builds-using-buildx#local-cache\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Local Cache\" title=\"Direct link to Local Cache\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>First things first we need to create a builder, and select it for use.

Without that you won't actually get a resulting image to run. However,\ndepending on your use case, this could be seen as a convenience - if you're\nwanting to run your tests inside your build; a resulting image isn't\nparticularly useful.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"remote-cache\">Remote Cache<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/10/08/improving-multistage-docker-builds-using-buildx#remote-cache\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Remote Cache\" title=\"Direct link to Remote Cache\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Now comes to the part I'm most interested in, caching in a stateless/remote\nenvironment. Multipart builds for us at OpenFn are essential, since we use\nElixir and like other compiled languages there is a lot to be gained by only\nshipping the stuff you're going to run; and no language is safe from requiring\nseveral times more 'stuff' in order to build our apps.</p>\n<p>Buildx supports a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/master/docs/reference/buildx_build.md#-export-build-cache-to-an-external-cache-destination---cache-to\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">handful of different types</a>\nof caching sources and destinations. We're going to be using the <code>registry</code>\ntype, where you point the cache at a repository reference (repo/image<!-- -->:tag<!-- -->\nstyle).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing to note is that Google Container Registry does not support the\nmetadata/manifest format that buildx uses, so if you're using Google Cloud you\nwill need to start using Artifact Registry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Inline</strong></p>\n<p>Push the image and the cache together:</p>\n<div class=\"language-text codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block\" style=\"--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e\"><div class=\"codeBlockContent_QJqH\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" class=\"prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar\" style=\"color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e\"><code class=\"codeBlockLines_e6Vv\"><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#bfc7d5\"><span class=\"token plain\">...</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#bfc7d5\"><span class=\"token plain\">--cache-from=type=registry,ref=$IMAGE_NAME \\</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#bfc7d5\"><span class=\"token plain\">--cache-to=type=inline \\</span><br></span><span class=\"token-line\" style=\"color:#bfc7d5\"><span class=\"token plain\">...</span><br></span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>This comes with the constraint that cache mode is always <code>min</code>, which only\nexports/caches the resulting layers; which is still better than the plain docker\nbuild caching but I think having the intermediary layers is generally a win.

to modify the initial <code>state</code> before we send that first\n<code>get</code> request to the insurance API. We determine if the new patient is a minor,\nand then use that newly calculated data to apply a query to the insurance API\nrequest.</p>\n<p>Using <code>fn(state =&gt; state)</code> or <code>alterState(state =&gt; state})</code> is incredibly\nuseful, because it allows us to separate our data manipulation, calculation, and\nraw Javascript (which will be harder for low-tech users to understand) from our\nexternal actions.

handoff easier. The business analyst\ncan say \"I need to have a registration <code>type</code> field available for use when\nquerying the insurance registry.\" A developer might respond, \"Great! How do you\nwant to calculate it... I've got all of Javascript at my fingertips.\" That dev\ncan then make as many API calls as they'd like, perform as many\n<code>map.reduce(...)</code> calls as their heart desires to complete that calculation...\nso long as they make sure the hand off <code>state</code> to the business analyst's\noperation with a valid <code>state.data.type</code> attribute.</p>\n<p>A final benefit of this approach is that it becomes much easier to generate job\nscripts from Google Sheets. Our implementation team frequently works with\nnon-technical clients to generate field maps that look like this:</p>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Path to Source Data</th><th>Destination Field</th><th style=\"text-align:right\">Auto-generated syntax (using concat)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>patient.fullName</td><td>name</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">field('name', dataValue('patient.fullName')),</td></tr><tr><td>patient.age</td><td>age</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">field('age', dataValue('patient.age')),</td></tr><tr><td>???</td><td>type</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">plz help us calculate 'type' based on x, y, z</td></tr><tr><td>patient.sex</td><td>gender</td><td style=\"text-align:right\">field('gender', dataValue('patient.sex')),</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<p>We can then copy and paste the syntax generated in that final column directly\ninto OpenFn and update the bits that need some sort of custom code, writing an\n<code>fn(state)</code> block or an <code>alterState(state)</code> block before the external action.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/07/05/wrapping-my-head-around-jobs#wrapping-up\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Wrapping up\" title=\"Direct link to Wrapping up\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Some key takeaways here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>Jobs start and end with <code>state</code> — some raw ingredients that will be used in a\nrecipe.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>Jobs are lists of <code>operations</code> — steps in a recipe that <em>each</em> take <code>state</code>,\n<em>do some stuff</em>, and then return <code>state</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"\">\n<p>As you move through the steps in a job, you are modifying <code>state</code>.

Until\nnow.</p>\n<p>So here goes. While this is by no means an exhaustive project planning template,\nhere are a few things to keep in mind if you're planning to implement a CommCare\nto Salesforce integration on your own.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"most-people-use-data-forwarding-in-commcare\">Most people use \"Data Forwarding\" in CommCare<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/05/24/commcare-events#most-people-use-data-forwarding-in-commcare\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Most people use &quot;Data Forwarding&quot; in CommCare\" title=\"Direct link to Most people use &quot;Data Forwarding&quot; in CommCare\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>First, most people make use of CommCare's \"Data Forwarding\" feature to send form\nsubmissions and changes in cases (creation, update, closure, etc.) to OpenFn in\nreal-time. You can read about that\n<a class=\"\" href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/adaptors/commcare#webhook-forward-cases-andor-forms-from-commcare-to-openfn-using-rest-service\">here</a>\nbut the key consideration at this planning stage is <em>when</em> you'll be performing\noperations—<code>create(...)</code>, <code>update(...)</code>, <code>upsert(...)</code>, <code>query(...)</code>,\n<code>(bulk(...)</code>, etc.—in Salesforce and what data you'll have access to.</p>\n<p>Each time a form submission comes into CommCare, we'll get a copy of that\nsubmission at OpenFn and can use that data to create or modify some records in\nSalesforce.</p>\n<p>Likewise, each time a case gets updated (or created or closed) we'll get a copy\nof the case with all the case \"properties\" and we can use that data to <em>do some\nstuff</em> in Salesforce.</p>\n<p>If you are using \"Form Forwarding\", the <code>trigger</code> you'd create in OpenFn might\nlook like this <code>{\"form\":{\"@name\":\"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\"}}</code> and it\nwould trigger your <code>job</code> any time an \"ART Adherence Self-Reporting Tool\"\nsubmission arrived from CommCare, giving that job access to all of the data\ninside that submission.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"working-with-the-data-that-comes-from-commcare\">Working with

            "content_html": "<p>“Syncing” is getting two systems to a state of harmony. This might mean keeping\na list of patients up to date, though modifications can be made in either\nsystem. It might mean copying transactions from one system to another on a\nnightly basis. It might mean a lot of things, but the key concept is that when\nyou sync systems, you’re asking them to work together while simultaneously\nrespecting both software systems’ independence.</p>\n<p>In this post we’ll discuss two different syncing protocols to consider when\ndesigning your data integration. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"\"><strong>Real-time, or event-based, syncs</strong></li>\n<li class=\"\"><strong>Scheduled syncs</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/spotlight/2021-02-09-interoperability-for-case-referrals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">recent project in Cambodia</a>,\nOpenFn is being used by social workers to automate case referrals between the\nsoftware systems Primero and OSCaR. In the design phase, we evaluated these two\nsyncing options. Below, we'll explain what each one is, the differences between\nthem and which option we chose in the end.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"real-timeevent-based-syncs\">Real Time/Event Based Syncs<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/17/syncing-options#real-timeevent-based-syncs\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Real Time/Event Based Syncs\" title=\"Direct link to Real Time/Event Based Syncs\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The first option considered for this integration was the real-time/event based\nsync. This type of sync is triggered whenever a specified event takes place in a\nsystem. With this approach, whenever a case is referred in Primero (via the user\ninterface, i.e., when a real case-worker clicks the “refer” button) OpenFn\nreceives a small payload with case data and transmits it to OSCaR and vice\nversa.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Real_Time_Sync\" src=\"https://docs.openfn.org/assets/images/syncs1-81446bbef450166c67a52b2ef7a48b10.webp\" width=\"1710\" height=\"716\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>Because of their instantaneous nature, real time/event based syncs are great for\nintegrations that involve mobile payments or sms messages to recipients. Really,\nanything that needs to be done “now”! Additionally, depending on your data\nvolumes real time syncs might save you money because you’re only using resources\nwhen specific events take place. For instance, in the above example, a run is\ntriggered by a referral, so if there are only 10 case referrals/month, you'd\nonly process 10 runs each month.</p>\n<p>This type of sync is great because it’s instantaneous, typically quite\nstraightforward to set up, doesn’t require any “state mangagement” on OpenFn,\nand allows for the reprocessing of individual events. There are, however,\ndrawbacks.</p>\n<p>For instance, what happens if the app that’s sending notifications to OpenFn\nfails to send? What if AWS or GCP goes down, taking half of the internet with\nit? If Primero “thinks” it sent the referral, OpenFn never receives it, that\ncase might not get referred to Oscar!</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"scheduled-syncs\">Scheduled Syncs<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/17/syncing-options#scheduled-syncs\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Scheduled Syncs\" title=\"Direct link to Scheduled Syncs\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Schedule_Dependent_Sync\" src=\"https://docs.openfn.org/assets/images/syncs2-7e3c3eacc4048afa5abfffc4aa1a188a.webp\" width=\"1710\" height=\"946\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>The second option considered, a bi-directional schedule dependent sync, solves\nfor the issue discussed above. On a scheduled basis (every 5 minutes, for\nexample) OpenFn checks with Primero and Oscar to see if case referrals need to\nbe transmitted between the two systems and then refers the case if required. In\nthe unlikely event that any of the software systems involved crash, the\nstability provided by the bi-directional sync means that all data is preserved\nand eventually makes it to its destination safely.</p>\n<p>The major drawback here is complexity. We had to use 4 jobs instead of 2, and\nthe job that is responsible for “pulling” data that’s been updated since the\ntime of the last successful sync has to keep “state”—or some sort of working\nmemory of what it’s done in the past. When pulling modified cases from Primero,\nOpenFn now only pulls cases modified on or after <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code> where\n<code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</code> is the time of the last successful, round-trip\nsynchronization. OpenFn has built-in functionality to handle exactly this\nrequirement, but not all ETL systems do and it’s a design implication that must\nbe considered.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, for the project in Cambodia, we decided that this sync option is the\nright choice because data integrity is more important than the speed of this\ndata flow. That’s a crucial point to understand—the organizations operating in\nCambodia decided that for this particular use case, being able to guarantee\neventual syncing was more important than having real-time syncing.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"both-sync-options-have-their-pros-and-cons\">Both Sync Options Have Their Pros and Cons<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/17/syncing-options#both-sync-options-have-their-pros-and-cons\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Both Sync Options Have Their Pros and Cons\" title=\"Direct link to Both Sync Options Have Their Pros and Cons\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Both options definitely have their use-cases and OpenFn's platform versatility\nenables your team to decide which type of sync is right for your project.</p>\n<p>As always, we are here to help with any questions as you think through which\nsync option makes the most sense for your project.</p>",

This means that Zandile’s iNGO will not be responsible for updating\nthe software to ensure compliance with new security regulations, maintaining the\nservers, backing up the data, purchasing and managing uninterrupted power\nsupplies, and providing a team of physical security guards to protect the\ncomputers and data therein against physical theft.</p>\n<p>Going the SaaS route is often faster and more secure, because you do not need to\ndevelop expertise in \"DevOps\" or hire IT and physical security specialists. This\noption also provides the greatest amount of flexibility &amp; scalability– because\nthe SaaS provider is able to deliver more or less computing power, storage, and\nbandwidth—right when it’s needed.</p>\n<p>Having smaller setup costs (you don't have to grow a software delivery company\nof your own) often makes this a more economical choice for many, though SaaS\nwill always come with some sort of ongoing fee—a price per month or year that\ngoes to the vendor to compensate for the time and money they'll spend to ensure\nyour software works properly.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"what-is-local-deployment\">What is Local Deployment?<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/03/hosted-or-local-deployment#what-is-local-deployment\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What is Local Deployment?\" title=\"Direct link to What is Local Deployment?\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>Unlike the SaaS option, local deployment means installing and running software\non your own computers—typically on your organization’s servers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"some-benefits-of-local-deployment\">Some benefits of Local Deployment<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/03/hosted-or-local-deployment#some-benefits-of-local-deployment\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Some benefits of Local Deployment\" title=\"Direct link to Some benefits of Local Deployment\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>If a SaaS provider doesn't offer hosting in your country and your government\ndoesn't allow your data to reside on foreign servers (i.e., you're not allowed\nto use things like Gmail, WhatsApp or Facebook for communicating sensitive\ninformation) then local deployment allows you to use tools like CommCare, DHIS2,\nand OpenFn while adhering to government data sovereignty regulations.</p>\n<p>Local deployment also provides your organization with complete ownership of the\nend-to-end system. Your IT team will be personally responsible for ensuring that\nthe software works, is maintained, is secure, etc. If your organization does not\nalready have an IT team in place, then this can become a costly headache, but\nfor a large organization with embedded IT experience, local deployment often\nmakes sense.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, being able to directly hire and fire the people who are responsible\nfor your software's proper functioning can be very useful. It means you have\ncomplete responsibility for whether or not the solution succeeds.</p>\n<p>If you've already got the teams in place (security, DevOps, etc.) then this\noption can be more economical in the long run. With a very good DevOps team,\nmaintaining an extra piece of software might only occupy 20% of a\nfull-time-employee's salary. For your security guards, if the software is\ninstalled in the same physical location it's possible that your costs won't\nincrease at all. While there will be very high setup costs, over time you may\nrealize cost savings by running an efficient software delivery unit within your\norganization that spreads its focus around a number of projects.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"zandiles-decision\">Zandile's Decision<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/03/hosted-or-local-deployment#zandiles-decision\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Zandile's Decision\" title=\"Direct link to Zandile's Decision\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>In this fictional case, data residency is a concern—her data is sensitive or\ncontains PII—and CommCare, DHIS2 and OpenFn do not provide hosting in the\ncountry she's located. Zandile's organization has a large, experienced IT team\nthat has managed high-availability software projects for many years... they're\npros. While they anticipate that the setup costs will be quite high (around\n$60000 and several months for this set of deployments) they plan on using this\nsoftware for the next 5 years and have determined that they'll recoup a\nsignificant portion of that setup cost by not having to pay license fees for\nSaaS. They go with local deployment.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"which-deployment-option-is-best-for-your-organization\">Which Deployment Option is Best for your organization?<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2021/02/03/hosted-or-local-deployment#which-deployment-option-is-best-for-your-organization\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Which Deployment Option is Best for your organization?\" title=\"Direct link to Which Deployment Option is Best for your organization?\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h2>\n<p>The answer is: \"it depends\", but if your organization has never managed local\nsoftware deployments, then we recommend going the SaaS approach. SaaS systems,\nlike the one OpenFn and CommCare offer, are simply going to be more secure, more\nstable, and more scalable for the money.</p>\n<p>Crucially, you can always start with SaaS (most tools even offer a free tier)\nand then decide later to invest in the big startup costs of a local deployment\nif the license fees for the SaaS feel high enough to make local deployment more\neconomical over the long term. After a few months or years on the SaaS, you'll\nlikely be in a better position to know if you want to continue using the\nsoftware for 5-10 years.</p>\n<p>Should you need any help with your decision though please do not hesitate to\ncontact OpenFn.</p>",

Set your trigger to <code>10</code> seconds\nand your job fetches data from DHIS2, some regional public health data set, or\nwhatever, then cleans, transforms, and loads it into some other system.</p>\n<p>For the most part, this has got the job done for the last 5 years, but as our\nNGO and government clients came up with increasingly specific requirements on\nnot only how often but <em>when</em> a crucial job gets executed, we began finding\nourselves creating little customizations for them on a once-off basis. We're\nhappy to annouce that as of <code>v1.75</code> (released today), you can now schedule jobs\nto run based on <code>cron</code> expressions, giving you incredible control over when your\ntasks get executed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"scheduling-is-better-than-timing\">Scheduling is better than timing.<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/07/14/cron-is-better-than-a-timer#scheduling-is-better-than-timing\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Scheduling is better than timing.\" title=\"Direct link to Scheduling is better than timing.\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Using <code>cron</code>, you can choose to run a job every minute by typing <code>* * * * *</code>.</p>\n<p>Or maybe you've got a batch sync that you want to take place while your users\nare asleep—why not run it every night at 11pm with <code>23 * * * *</code>.</p>\n<p>What if you've got to submit reuqests for medical inventory only during the\nonset of flu season? Simply type <code>0 0 1 2-4 *</code> and your job will run at midnight\nthe 1st of the month, from February through April.</p>\n<p>You can still run jobs at the click of a button and create timers with\nexpressions like <code>*/10 * * * *</code> for \"every 10 minutes\", but scheduling with cron\ngives OpenFn.org users so much more control over how they run their\norganizations.

Over the last 6 years, OpenFn has been implemented worldwide for a\nwide range of use cases, including building real-time data monitoring systems,\nstreamlining data cleaning pipelines, securely exchanging sensitive information,\nand automating routine processes like uploading indicator results, sending\nSMS/email alerts, making mobile payments,\n<a href=\"https://openfn.org/solutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">and more</a>.</p>\n<p>By connecting any app, OpenFn can integrate and automate all apps within a\ndigital ecosystem. However, a question that we frequently ask our partners is:</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"just-because-you-can-automateshould-you\">Just because you <em>can</em> automate—<em>should</em> you?<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/24/three-questions-to-ask#just-because-you-can-automateshould-you\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to just-because-you-can-automateshould-you\" title=\"Direct link to just-because-you-can-automateshould-you\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h4>\n<p>While integration and automation have the potential to enable scale and save\ntime and money (we’ve learned this from our\n<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/24/openfn.org/clients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">partners</a>), solutions require investment to set up\nand maintain. These costs sometimes outweigh expected efficiency gains and\nservice outcomes. Therefore, when evaluating the cost-benefit of investing in\nautomation and integration solutions, we at Open Function Group typically ask 3\nkey questions.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"1-security--will-automation-limit-the-exposure-of-sensitive-data\">1. Security — Will automation limit the exposure of sensitive data?<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/24/three-questions-to-ask#1-security--will-automation-limit-the-exposure-of-sensitive-data\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to 1.

Security — Will automation limit the exposure of sensitive data?\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Can the exposure of sensitive data be limited by integrating with secure API\nendpoints (rather than relying on human beings to interact with those data, for\nexample)? Or by automating a data cleaning process?</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"2-accuracy--will-automation-increase-data-accuracy-and-reduce-data-entry-errors\">2.

Speed — Will automation increase the speed of impact?\" title=\"Direct link to 3. Speed — Will automation increase the speed of impact?\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Can the process be done more quickly via automation and is there value in having\nit done faster? (The answer to the first part is almost always yes, but\nsometimes there's not actually lots of value generated by doing something\nfaster.)</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"if-you-find-yourself-answering-yes-to-these-questions-it-may-be-time-to-consider-automating-critical-processes-at-your-organization\">If you find yourself answering “yes” to these questions, it may be time to consider automating critical processes at your organization.<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/24/three-questions-to-ask#if-you-find-yourself-answering-yes-to-these-questions-it-may-be-time-to-consider-automating-critical-processes-at-your-organization\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to If you find yourself answering “yes” to these questions, it may be time to consider automating critical processes at your organization.\" title=\"Direct link to If you find yourself answering “yes” to these questions, it may be time to consider automating critical processes at your organization.\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Tasks that meet these 3 criteria, take a lot of time to complete or are very\nrepetitive, and/or involve moving data between apps are typically great\ncandidates for automation.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself answering “no”, then it may not be worth the investment in\nautomation... at least not yet. This is especially true if these processes are\nstill in flux or require a lot of human involvement to complete. That said, now\nmay be a good time to refine your existing workflows, think about how your\nprocesses might change at scale, and consider what <em>new</em> processes, services, or\noutcomes could be unlocked by automation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"delegate-your-busywork-to-openfn-and-try-it-today\">Delegate your busywork to OpenFn, and try it today!<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/24/three-questions-to-ask#delegate-your-busywork-to-openfn-and-try-it-today\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Delegate your busywork to OpenFn, and try it today!\" title=\"Direct link to Delegate your busywork to OpenFn, and try it today!\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>If you want to try out automation for your organization,\n<a href=\"https://www.openfn.org/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"\">sign up</a> for OpenFn, free of charge.

I thought I was getting into a technical\ndiscussion—I’ve been doing system architecture discussions for years—but what we\nended up talking about was how this NGO thinks.</p>\n<p>This engagement is largely about mapping an already existing “people &amp; paper”\nbased system to technology. Vera Solutions will build a system for this client\nusing Open Data Kit for field data collection and Salesforce.com for the\nmanagement “back-end”. Because we’re not explicitly being asked to help redesign\nprocesses at this organization, the client is “telling us how things are”, then\nexpecting us to create a relational database model that facilitates\nbusiness-as-usual, only in a more efficient, digital way.

They coordinate various activities in their target communities and\nreport on those activities against numerous (sometimes overlapping) indicators.\nSound familiar? As we get to the 3rd explanation of these programs, and the 11th\niteration of the system schema, it hits me…</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"drawing-a-relational-object-model-sounds-technical-but-its-actually-an-exercise-in-clear-communication-and-everyone-can-benefit-from-it\">Drawing a \"relational object model\" sounds technical, but it's actually an exercise in clear communication... and everyone can benefit from it.<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/16/how-information-is-organized#drawing-a-relational-object-model-sounds-technical-but-its-actually-an-exercise-in-clear-communication-and-everyone-can-benefit-from-it\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Drawing a &quot;relational object model&quot; sounds technical, but it's actually an exercise in clear communication... and everyone can benefit from it.\" title=\"Direct link to Drawing a &quot;relational object model&quot; sounds technical, but it's actually an exercise in clear communication... and everyone can benefit from it.\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>When we—human beings—wrestle with complex problems (like managing lots of\nprograms, other humans, community stakeholders, etc.) we have the capacity to\ntrick ourselves into thinking that we have wrapped our heads around a system\n(for clinic registration, for after-school education, etc.) when, in fact, we’re\nengaging in mental hand-waving and are simply ‘papering-over’ sections which are\nsecretly not just complicated, but totally incongruous with other parts of the\nsystem. We can make ourselves believe that our logic is sound because we want it\nto be sound, when in reality the organization might be held together by good\npeople, not good, clear, defined processes.

width=\"1920\" height=\"622\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>The crow’s foot is my second favorite. It’s used to show relationships between\nentities. We know that teachers are related to the sessions that they conduct.\n(And <code>session</code> might be another entity, with fields like <code>date</code>,\n<code>subject taught</code>, and <code>venue</code>, to name just a few.) The crow’s foot allows us to\nspecify exactly how they are related. On that session entity, we’ll need to\nspecify the name (or ID) of the teacher who led it. On the teacher entity,\nhowever, there won’t be a field to specify the name or ID of the session…\nbecause a single teacher can lead MANY sessions. This is a one-to-many\nrelationship. The crow’s foot (that little three-pronged fella) denotes the\nmany. One teacher can have many sessions. One session, however, can only have\none teacher. See the diagram below.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://docs.openfn.org/assets/images/objectmodel3-f8773ce38dd6bda67c896f6546ded810.webp\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1316\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>If we focus just on <code>teacher</code> and <code>session</code> and think back to MS Excel, we can\nenvision a <code>teachers</code> table and a <code>sessions</code> table. Let’s put them on different\nsheets in the same workbook. On the <code>teachers</code> table, there is no column for\n<code>session</code>, but on the <code>sessions</code> table, there <em>is</em> a column for <code>teacher ID</code>.\nWe’ve just established a one-to-many relationship.</p>\n<p>Next time, we’ll talk about what’s going with the <code>attendance</code> entity above.\nIt’s sometimes called a “junction object” or a “join table”, and it’s what\nallows MANY students to be related to MANY sessions. I’ll write more on this\nnext time, but there is no magic going on, no technicalities here. The way that\nmany students are related to many sessions is through this Real World Concept\nthat we call <code>attendance</code>. Attendance is what happens when a student shows up at\na session. It’s so important to get the language right in these discussions, and\nmake sure that you’re talking about real-world concepts.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"relational-object-models-with-lots-of-confusing-terms-are-not-technical-they-are-bad\">Relational object models with lots of confusing terms are not \"technical\".

Understanding\nrelational object modelling is an incredibly powerful way to organize a company.\nAs I said before, if you can’t model it with boxes and arrows, it’s a smell that\nsomething might not be conceptually sound.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq\" id=\"a-disclaimer-and-some-thoughts-on-scaling\">A disclaimer and some thoughts on scaling:<a href=\"https://docs.openfn.org/articles/2020/06/16/how-information-is-organized#a-disclaimer-and-some-thoughts-on-scaling\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to A disclaimer and some thoughts on scaling:\" title=\"Direct link to A disclaimer and some thoughts on scaling:\" translate=\"no\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Some organizations do amazing work without good conceptual systems. They rely on\nhumans, instinct, improvisation, nouse, and other not-so-clearly-defined things.\nThey might do really great work. They might get the job done. But they need to\nbe well aware of their condition and face it head on. If you can’t systematize\nyour program implementation processes, then you need to focus tremendous effort\non finding and retaining the right people.</p>\n<p>A friend once told me that “people are not scalable.” I couldn’t agree more, and\ndefend my earlier stance that if your organization’s information structure can’t\nbe defined with boxes and crow’s feet, it may be very hard for you to scale\nresponsibly. However, if you can create a ruthlessly efficient, world-class\n“people operations” system (recruitment, training, management, compensation, HR,\netc.) that ensures you’ve always got the right people to figure things out you\nmight be better off than those operating a well defined assembly-line with\ninterchangeable parts. Alas, the middle way is probably the best.</p>\n<p>That’s all for now. More soon.</p>\n<p><em>Need help organizing or scaling your organization's information or process\nflows?
