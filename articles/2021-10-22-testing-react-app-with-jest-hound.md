Have you ever struggled to layout the strategy for testing your React App? Well,
you are not alone! Here a few hints from the lessons I learned during my
experience testing a
[React](https://reactjs.org/)/[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) app with a
[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/)/[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)
backend.

## The Blurred Line

Because a React app is built on
[components](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), the basic UI units,
it is natural to think and organise your tests around components! And so unit
testing, in this case, would refer to "component testing", which may be
confusing at times, especially when the concept of unit testing is again applied
to testing functions such as Redux `reducers` and `action creators` or any other
JavaScript function in your application.

The other challenge that I often faced was whether to write tests for each
component in isolation or write a test for a feature that encapsulates a set of
related components. The later would be equivalent to writing what I would call
"integration tests".

Finally, one would say "well then you could have just written the tests in a way
that resemble the way the application is used"! This approach is commonly
recommended in the React community, but it quickly becomes really complex to
maintain the layers of separation between **_unit tests_**, **_integration
tests_** and **_end-to-end tests_**.

## What did I learn?

Given a React/Redux application, here is how I would organise my testing
strategy:

### Unit Tests

- In a React app, **unit tests** will largely apply to testing "helper
  functions" and not to testing components, as justified in the next section.
  Helper functions, in this case, would refer to functions that live outside the
  components and are neither Redux action creators nor reducers. These functions
  can be used inside components, action creators, reducers or other parts of
  your application.

- Writing unit tests for "helper functions" would ensure their signatures and
  expected outputs are protected against regressions. This would also ensure
  their use across components or other functions is consistent and as expected.

- Where possible, each "helper function" must have its own `unit test`.

- An example of a unit test would like:

  ```javascript
  const sum = require('../../js/sum');

  test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
  ```

- Write a _thousand_ of these.

### Integration Tests

- In the context of a React/Redux app, component tests can be thought of as
  **integration tests**. This is because React components are built around
  features such as `<Signup />`, `<Search />`, etc. So one React component can
  be a mix of other components to achieve a UI feature set.

- To test a component, write an **integration test** that covers the use of a
  given component for a given UI feature.

- If a component being tested dispatches a Redux `action`, this is the right
  place to test those actions and their effect on the UI.

- Pay attention to the concept of _feature isolation_ vs _component isolation_
  as it will help you write better integration tests and also easily mock
  component contexts.

- A classic example of **feature isolation** is when you have a `<UserList />`
  component which displays a list of users and has a `<button />` to add a new
  user. Writing a test for `<UserList />` would be equivalent to testing a
  feature.

- In this example, one would be tempted to test the action of clicking on the
  `<AddUserButton />` and further test the `<NewUser />` form... nope! This is
  where we draw the line! Only test that the `<UserList />` renders the mock
  `users` in the list and that the `<AddUserButton />` is present/enabled. The
  `<UserList />` feature ends there, otherwise you will be sliding into
  **End-to-End** testing :)! The `<User />` component, although it is invoked by
  `<UserList />` component, it is isolated enough to be tested in its own
  integration test.

- Testing components this way would make "context mocking" easier for
  components.

- Another important benefit for isolating testing context, as in the example
  above, is that it will be easier to mock the `redux actions` and/or api calls
  using tools such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and
  [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) (or "msw") as explained in the
  [Choosing Tools](#choosing-testing-tools) section.

- The value of writing integration tests for components, in this way, ensures
  that a given component renders the UI consistently, given all possible
  combinations of contexts and interactions. This will also allow you to ensure
  redux actions invoked by the component are called as expected and with the
  correct arguments.

- An example component integration test would look like:

  ```javascript
  // ....other imports
  import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
  // Tell jest to mock the module
  jest.mock('../js/actions/UserActions', () => ({
    ...jest.requireActual('../js/actions/UserActions'),
    saveUser: jest.fn(),
  }));

  import { saveUser as mockSaveUser } from '../js/actions/UserActions';
  const server = setupServer(...handlers);
    // Enable API mocking before tests
    beforeAll(() => server.listen());
    // Reset any runtime handlers we may add during the tests
    afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
    // Disable API mocking after the tests are done.
    afterAll(() => server.close());
    beforeEach(() => {
      jest.clearAllMocks();
    });
  describe('<AddUser/>', () => {

  test('create new user', async () => {
      const {getByPlaceholderText,getByText} = render(<User {...defaultProps} />);
      userEvent.type(getByPlaceholderText('First Name'), 'John');
      userEvent.type(getByPlaceholderText('Last Name'), 'Doe');
      userEvent.click(getByText('Save'));
      expect(mockSaveUser).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
      expect(mockSaveUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
      });
  }

  ```

- Write a _good couple_ of these.

### End-to-End (e2e) Tests

- In a React/Redux App, this would mean testing a _full flow_ of a given
  feature. **end-to-end tests** would require launching the entire application,
  including the backend, to run a given test.

- Note that **end-to-end tests** are different from **integration tests** as
  they require the entire App to run and render the full flow to your component
  under test.

- With this understanding, consider writing **e2e** tests _per workflow_.

- An example **e2e workflow** is the "Viewing and adding users" workflow.

- The e2e test for this workflow would require a test runner to launch the app,
  log-in, navigate to the users list page, verify existing users are in the
  list, click on the Add New User button and confirm that the new user has been
  added to the list.

- As you can see, e2e tests have more dependencies and require that you setup
  your testing environment in way that closely simulates your real application
  usage.

- An example e2e test for a React/Redux App with a Phoenix/Elixir backend, using
  `Hound` as a test runner looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule OpenFn.UsersTest do
  setup do
    user = insert(:user, confirmed_at: DateTime.utc_now())
    {:ok, user: user }
  end

  @tag :integration
  test "Sign-up.", %{user: user} do
    navigate_to("/sign-up")
    form = find_element(:id, "sign_up_form")

    form
    |> find_within_element(:id, "first-name")
    |> fill_field("John")

    form
    |> find_within_element(:id, "last-name")
    |> fill_field("Doe")

    form
    |> find_within_element(:id, "email")
    |> fill_field("doe@gmail.com")

    form
    |> find_within_element(:id, "save-button")
    |> click

    assert page_title() === ~s/Welcome to my page/
    end
end
```

- Write _only a few_ of these.

## Choosing Testing Tools

There are many testing tools out there, but for a typical _React/Redux_ app the
following tools should help you accomplish the above tasks:

1. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) as test runner for **unit**
   and **integration** tests.
2. [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/) used along with
   Jest as an "assertion library" for integration tests.
3. [MSW](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started/install) used along with Jest as
   a REST API mocking library.
4. [Hound](https://hexdocs.pm/hound/readme.html) as a test runner for **e2e**
   tests in Elixir/Phoenix apps.
   [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) can also be
   used along with Jest.
   - If Puppeteer is used, it will work seamlessly with Jest but only in
     headless browser mode. It also reduces on tech stack since you will only
     need Jest.
   - Hound gives you the ability to run your **e2e** tests both in `headless`
     and `browser` mode.

## Final thoughts and next steps

Testing a React App can be really hard, but worth it! By building
`Aria-accessible` components ahead of time, you save yourself ðŸ’° and good
health! A few more hints would be:

- Build clean, isolated and plugable components for your better testing
  experience. "God components" can be a _pain_ to test!
- Using test runners such as Jest, that use _emulated_ web browsers (e.g.,
  `jsdom`) rather than a real browser come with their own challenges in
  rendering and traversing complex DOM trees, especially if you are using UI
  libraries such as [MUI](https://mui.com/).
- If using Jest for **integration tests**, I would recommend the components
  under test have as few dependencies as possible to avoid the complexity
  involved in mocking http requests and waiting for asynchronous DOM rendering.

What would I do differently? Here are my few thoughts:

- Organise and document detailed test cases for manual "click testing".
- Identify and clearly isolate components for **integration tests**.
- Do not _delete_ slow tests, instead re-write your component to be faster.
  Respect the linter's advice, always!
- Use a commonly supported frontend testing stack such as Jest, Msw, or
  Puppeteer for easier setup and community support.
- Setup your test runner to use a test database. It helps, especially during
  **e2e** testing.
- Always write **_all the three types_** of tests, whenever applicable.

All this stuff for what?

- Well because regressions can be much more expensive to your organisation!
  Writing high quality and thoroughly tested software will save you ðŸ’° and help
  guarantee a maintainable codebase and a progressive software application.

:::tip Still looking for the legend's advice?

Gotcha, here you go...

1. Swallow your pride and be humble: _always_ do **manual testing!**
2. Click test your way through the **manual test cases** for every new
   deployment, catching regressions.
3. _Lock in_ your fixes and new features as **unit tests**, **integration
   tests**, and **end-to-end tests**.

Happy testing,
